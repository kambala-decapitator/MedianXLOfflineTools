[size=1]Just in case, here's the Russian thread: http://forum.worldofplayers.ru/showthread.php?t=34489[/size]

As you can guess from the title, it's an almost complete offline analogue of grig's [url=http://grig.vlexofree.com/]Median XL Online Tools[/url], but with nice additions.

Application should be able to load character from any version of Median XL and successfully perform basic operations with it like respeccing. Items processing relies on the mod source files, so it may not be compatible with any chacarcter from different version. This data is softcoded, so when a new mod version is released, usually there's no need to recompile the application — one just needs to replace the data found in 'resources/data' with the new one, which I will release. Current supported Median XL version is 2012 v005, first supported one — Omega v003; current supported version of Ultimative is v6b (v5+ actually), first one — v4.

It's written in C++ using the Qt library (v4.8.4 as of current release), so don't hope to dotnetreflect the source code (and it won't be released for obvious reasons). The app comes with English and Russian localization. If you want to create your own localization (or use items data from another mod version), grab translation toolkit from the Downloads section.

I hope I provided enough anti-hack protection for an average user. If you manage to successfully hack your character and save him using this application, please report it to me so that I could fix the exploit :)

Q: I can't unrar the distributed archive without errors :(
A: Use 7zip.

Q: I don't understand how to copy mod data on Mac OS X!
A: I've posted detailed instructions [url=http://modsbylaz.14.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?p=426604#426604]here[/url]. If you still don't understand what to do or you're lazy to move files by hand, then open Terminal, cd to where you unpacked mod data (this folder should contain unpacked 'resources' folder) and use the following shell script:
[code]APP_PATH = "/Applications/MedianXLOfflineTools.app" # place the actual path inside quotes, it's just an example
cp -R resources/data/* "${APP_PATH}/Contents/resources/data"[/code]
