[size=1]Just in case, here's the Russian thread: http://worldofplayers.ru/threads/34489/[/size]

[size=18][color=#6666ff]This is [b][u]NOT[/u][/b] a cheating tool![/color][/size]

As you can guess from the title, it's an almost complete offline analogue of grig's [url=http://grig.vlexofree.com/]Median XL Online Tools[/url], but with nice additions.

Application should be able to load character from any version of Median XL and successfully perform basic operations with it like respeccing. Items processing relies on the mod source files, so it may not be compatible with any chacarcter from different version. This data is softcoded, so when a new mod version is released, usually there's no need to recompile the application â€” one just needs to replace the data found in 'resources/data' with the new one, which I will provide. Currently supported mod versions:
[list][*]Median XL 2012 v005 (earlier versions should also work)
[*]Ultimative X (v5+ characters should be compatible)
[*]Kehjan Labyrinth + Tathamet vs Anu
[*]Hardened
[/list]
The app comes with English and Russian localization. If you want to create your own localization (or use items data from another mod version), grab translation toolkit from the Downloads section.

It's written in C++ using the [url=http://qt-project.org]Qt framework[/url] (v4.8.5 as of current release), so don't hope to dotnetreflect the source code (and it won't be released for obvious reasons).

I hope I provided enough anti-hack protection for an average user. If you manage to successfully hack your character and save him using this application, please report it to me so that I could fix the exploit :)

[size=18][color=#6666ff]WARNING: by default you can open only characters from [b]Ultimative X[/b]. If you want to open characters from other mods/mod versions, please refer to the [b]Mod data[/b] download section.[/color][/size]

[b]Downloads[/b]:
[list][*][b]Application[/b]:
[list][*][i]Windows[/i] (XP SP 2 and later): http://www.mediafire.com/?dp72kmkmo83tuph
[*][i]Mac OS X[/i] (10.5 and later, universal binary): http://www.mediafire.com/?qst3josrf9dpzap
[/list][*][b]Mod data[/b] (find installation instructions in Mini-FAQ below; you don't actually need to download these because both archives are included in the application distribution):

[/list][/list]

[b]Mini-FAQ[/b]:
Q: I can't unrar the distributed archive without errors :(
A: Use 7zip, Luke.

Q: How to install mod data?
A: Restart the application after following actions if it's running.
[list][*]Windows: unpack the archive in a folder that contains MedianXLOfflineTools.exe replacing everything
[*]Mac OS X: unpack the archive somewhere and...
[list][*]short answer: move [b]the contents of 'resources/data', not the 'data' folder itself[/b], to 'MedianXLOfflineTools.app/Contents/Resources/data'
[*]long 'manual' answer: open unpacked folder, open 'resources' folder inside, Select All (Cmd+A), Copy (Cmd+C), locate MedianXLOfflineTools.app, right-click (or Control-click) it, select 'Show package contents', open Contents/Resources/data folder, Paste (Cmd+V) replacing everything
[*]long 'terminal' answer: open Terminal, cd to where you unpacked mod data (this folder should contain unpacked 'resources' folder) and use the following shell script:
[code]APP_PATH = "/Applications/MedianXLOfflineTools.app" # place the actual path inside double quotes, it's just an example
cp -R resources/data/* "${APP_PATH}/Contents/resources/data"[/code]
[/list][/list]

Q: I've fcked up my character and/or PlugY stash and neither the game nor this application can load it. How can I restore it from backup?
A: Go to the save folder and look for file(s) called <chararcter>.<d2s or d2x>_<date>.bak and delete everything on the right up to d2s or d2x. If it's the shared stash you want to restore, then it's called _LOD<_HC for hardcore>_SharedStashSave.sss_<date>.bak and delete everything on the right up to sss.
If you can't see file extension:
[list][*]Windows Explorer: Folder Options - View - Scroll to the bottom - Uncheck 'Hide extensions...' - OK
[*]Mac OS X Finder: Preferences - Last tab (Advanced or similar name) - Show all file name extensions[/list]
