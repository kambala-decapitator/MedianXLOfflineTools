"A4Q2ExpansionSuccessTyrael"	"40\nPraise be to the Light! You have \naccomplished the impossible! \nDiablo and Mephisto have been\nbanished back into the Black Abyss\nthat spawned them, and the corrupted\nSoulstones are no more.\n\nHowever, while you were fighting here,\nBaal remained behind in the mortal\nrealm, building an army of hellish\nminions. Now, Baal's army is searching\nfor the Worldstone, the ancient source\nof all the Soulstones and their power,\nwhile leaving behind a wake of\ndestruction. They have forged deeply\ninto the Barbarian homelands, heading\ndirectly for the summit of Mount\nArreat!\n\nBaal knows, mortal hero! That is the\nvery site of the blessed Worldstone!\n\nNow, enter the portal I have opened for\nyou. It will take you to the Barbarian\ncity of Harrogath, the last bastion of\nOrder on the slopes of Arreat.\n"
"A4Q2ExpansionSuccessCain"	"40\nI knew there was great potential in you, \nmy friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n \nThough my ancestors often struggled \nagainst the Three Evils and their \nminions, I've always lived a shut-in, \nscholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom \naided you.\n \nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though \nHeaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, \nI hope I won't have to see them again \nfor many, many years.\n \nPlease talk to Tyrael about leaving this \nplace now!\n"
"AncientsAct5IntroGossip1"	"35\nWe are the spirits of the Nephalem, the \nAncient Ones. We have been chosen to \nguard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein \nthe Worldstone rests. Few are worthy \nto stand in its presence; fewer still can \ncomprehend its true purpose.\n \nBefore you enter, you must defeat us.\n"
"CainAct5IntroGossip1"	"39\nI am amazed to find this place so \nuntouched. Everything else in the path \nof Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in \nruin. \n \nThese Barbarians must indeed be the \nlegendary guardians of Mount Arreat. \nThey are a proud, hardy people. Don't \nexpect to be greeted warmly -- \nstrangers here rarely are.\n \nPerhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend \nsome time with the townsfolk and try \nto understand them better. I'll let you \nknow what I discover.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip1"	"52\nWith hellspawn, size is no measure of \ntheir threat. Demons half the size of \nmen can kill with a gesture, while \nhellish pack animals trample any who \nstand in their way.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip2"	"55\nThough these Barbarians are known \nthroughout the kingdoms as ferocious \nfighters, they are also capable of great \ncompassion.\n \nThey have trained throughout history \nfor a battle their legends foretell will \ndecide the fate of the world.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip3"	"55\nThe angel Tyrael has watched over the \nguardians of Arreat throughout \nhistory. I do not believe that Baal and \nTyrael have come to fight over a paltry \nfew souls.\n \nThey are here to settle a conflict as old \nas time itself.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip4"	"44\nDuring my time with the Horadrim, we \noften debated the nature of Mount \nArreat.\n \nWe knew that the Barbarian clans \nzealously guarded the mountain as \ntheir sacred duty. However, many \ndismissed their zeal as simple \nsuperstition...combined with an inborn \nhostility toward outsiders.\n \nThose Horadrim who trekked up Arreat \nwere never heard from again...Still, I \ndo not believe they died at the hands of \nBarbarians.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip5"	"41\nAll users of the magical arts know of \nMount Arreat, but few understand its \ntrue nature. It is the nexus of an \nunfathomable magic.\n \nIt bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction \nraces to its summit with such purpose. \nI fear for the whole world should Baal \ngain what he seeks.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip6"	"59\nI have spent decades trying to \nunderstand the forces at work in this \nworld. But in the face of all that is \ntranspiring, I realize how meager my \nknowledge is.\n \nI will be of assistance where I can, my \nfriend.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip7"	"54\nThough the Elder Council of Harrogath \nis gone, there are many capable young \nleaders to take their place.\n \nAnya certainly has enough courage and \nintelligence to lead them all, if they can \nsurvive this catastrophe.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip8"	"53\nAh, Anya. Such a fine example of \nfeminine strength...\n \nShe reminds me of the Zakarum \npriestesses I knew in my youth. They \ndon't take vows of chastity, you know.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip9"	"65\nIt is fortunate that this town has such a \ntalented smith.\n \nThe quality of Larzuk's work surely \ncomplements your skills. In fact, he \nwould have been quite welcome \namongst the Horadrim.\n"
"CainAct5Gossip10"	"54\nIt is my belief that the Soulstones are at \nthe center of this conflict. If only that \nfool Marius had not intervened, Baal \nwould still be imprisoned within Tal \nRasha.\n"
"AnyaAct5IntroGossip1"	"54\nYou have proven yourself a true hero to \nme and my people.\n \nThese are dark times, warrior. I hope \nyou can bring an end to Baal's reign of \ndestruction. \n \nOur Council of Elders is gone -- my \nfather, Aust, among them. The one \nthing that keeps us from total despair \nis the promise of vengeance against \nBaal.\n"
"AnyaGossip1"	"45\nNow that the Elders are all dead, I don't \nknow who will guide our people through \nthis dark time. I was to be next in line \nafter my father, but this burden is too \ngreat for me to shoulder alone. \n \nWe are a people of strong blood. I shall \ndo what I can and let fate do the rest.\n"
"AnyaGossip2"	"82\nBaal's minions are not to be trifled with. \nIn their bloodlust they will sacrifice \nthemselves to destroy you.\n"
"AnyaGossip3"	"60\nMany outsiders believe that the \nfantastic stories about our ancestors, \nthe Ancients, are but fables. However, I \nbelieve that the Ancients were more \nthan human -- that mankind has fallen \nfrom what it once was.\n"
"AnyaGossip4"	"58\nWhen I was a child, the Elders told us \nstories about the mountain and its \npower...and how the Barbarian people \nare bound to it as protectors.\n \nBaal is not just taking our land -- with \nevery step he takes up the mountain, \nhe takes a part of who we are as a \npeople.\n"
"AnyaGossip5"	"72\nI am truly glad you are here, warrior. \nPerhaps things would be different now \nif we had asked for assistance from \nthe neighboring kingdoms.\n \nOur foolish, foolish pride...\n"
"AnyaGossip6"	"54\nMy father, Aust, was among those \nElders wise enough to see that we \nwould need outside help to deal with \nBaal's legions. He believed that this \nconflict would affect the entire world, \nnot just our homeland. He said that \nMount Arreat is as necessary to the \nworld's survival as food and water is to \nour own.\n \nI believe this to be true.\n"
"AnyaGossip7"	"50\nQual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities \nonce bordered on arrogance, but in the \nearly days of the siege, he was \nhumbled by Baal. While he saved us \nfrom immediate destruction, a third of \nour warriors were lost.\n \nNone felt those losses more than he. \nThough he may not admit it, your \npresence gives him hope, warrior.\n"
"AnyaGossip8"	"78\nIf Larzuk could sing or dance half as \nwell as he smiths, he'd be married by \nnow.\n \n...Just look at those shoulders.\n"
"AnyaGossip9"	"57\nNihlathak was the last of our Elders, \nwhose charge it was to safeguard the \nmountain. He alone tried to guide us \nthrough the most desperate time in our \nhistory -- but he was just as helpless as \nthe rest of us.\n \nI cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can \nlearn from it.\n"
"AnyaGossip10"	"60\nOur people believe that the Ancients \nprotecting Mount Arreat have the \npower to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the \nLord of Destruction has shown great \npower to undermine our faith.\n"
"LarzukAct5IntroGossip1"	"55\nI am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors \nwere some of the finest craftsmen in \nHarrogath. \n \nRegretfully, my supplies run lower with \nevery passing day, yet the demons \nbeyond the walls have not weakened. \n \nI fear the time is near when I must put \ndown my hammer and take up a sword, \ninstead.\n"
"LarzukAct5IntroAmaGossip1"	"42\nSo, you're an Amazon. I have heard \nrumors about your kind. Your unusual \nweapons could prove a challenge to my \nskills, but I'm prepared to meet it.\n \nI am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors \nwere some of the finest craftsmen in \nHarrogath. Regretfully, my supplies run \nlower with every passing day, yet the \ndemons beyond the walls have not \nweakened. I fear the time is near when \nI must put down my hammer and take \nup a sword, instead.\n"
"LarzukGossip1"	"65\nI've heard that you Amazons excel at \nkilling from a distance. From what I've \nseen, that's the best way to deal with \nHell's minions. \n \nAre all of your kind so...big?\n"
"LarzukGossip2"	"65\nWhy did you ever leave your beautiful \nislands to come to this frozen \nbattleground? Perhaps if we both \nsurvive this, we'll travel back there \ntogether.\n"
"LarzukGossip3"	"75\nHas that infernal howling been keeping \nyou awake at night, too? Some think \nit's the howling of animals, but those \nsounds don't come from any beast I've \never known.\n"
"LarzukGossip4"	"69\nDemonic forces have been using our \nown towers and barricades against us. \nYou know, it would be wise to cut the \ndemons down in the open before they \ncan mount those fortifications.\n"
"LarzukGossip5"	"70\nNihlathak's despair is infectious -- and \nhis behavior does not befit an Elder of \nhis stature. I think we'd be better off \nwithout him.\n"
"LarzukGossip6"	"63\nI've offered Qual-Kehk my ideas on how \nto break the siege, but he dismisses \nthem. Is it because I lack scars of \nbattle, or does he think I'm a couple \narrows short of a quiver?\n"
"LarzukGossip7"	"64\nLegend has it that the top of Mount \nArreat is guarded by the spirits of our \nancestors. Though our people are \nforbidden to climb to the mountain's \nsummit, some foreign travelers have \nmade the attempt.\n \nNone have ever returned.\n"
"LarzukGossip8"	"66\nThis is a lively town during our victory \ncelebrations. We Barbarians train long \nand hard from childhood to become \nwarriors, and we celebrate with equal \nfervor.\n \nYou didn't happen to bring along any \nale to trade?\n"
"LarzukGossip9"	"54\nEvery day, one of my friends dies \nfighting outside the town walls, while I \ntend my anvil here unscathed. If only \nwe didn't need weapons so badly, I \ncould be out doing my share of the \nfighting. \n \nGood luck to you, warrior.\n"
"LarzukGossip10"	"56\nJust so you know...The gold you pay me \ndoesn't line my pockets. Much of it \ngoes to buy the raw metal I need to \nmelt down for weapons and armor. The \nrest -- well, all I can spare -- goes to \nMalah and Qual-Kehk for other \nsupplies.\n"
"MalahAct5IntroGossip1"	"35\nI, Malah, welcome you to Harrogath, \nthe last stronghold of Order on Mount \nArreat. You have come to the right \nplace if you intend to defeat Baal the \nLord of Destruction.\n \nBaal has laid waste to our mountain \nand its denizens.

"MalahAct5IntroBarGossip1"	"34\nYou have traveled far only to return \nhome to us, Barbarian.

Seeing you again -- alive \n-- does my heart good. I shall pray that \nyou can help us out of this hell.\n \nBaal has laid waste to our mountain \nand its denizens.

"MalahGossip1"	"53\nI'm aware of the amazing magical \npowers a Sorceress can channel. If we \nsurvive Baal's wrath, I would be most \nhonored if you could demonstrate and \nperhaps teach me something of what \nyou know. \n \nI may be old, but I'm not dead.\n"
"MalahGossip2"	"42\nI know you and my son, Bannuk, did not \npart on the best of terms. He did not \nunderstand the wanderlust that drove \nyou to leave your homeland. However, \neven though Bannuk could never admit \nit to me, as he grew older I could see \nthat same desire in his eyes.\n \nOh...It's a pity I didn't encourage him to \ngo with you. He might still be alive \ntoday.\n"
"MalahGossip3"	"57\nThough once considered shelter by our \npeople, the Ice Caves offer no refuge \nfrom the dark horde. There are \ncreatures there that will freeze your \nheart before feasting upon it.\n"
"MalahGossip4"	"107\nOn the battlefield, turning your back on \neven the dead is unwise.\n"
"MalahGossip5"	"60\nThis battle plays mind tricks on our \nwarriors. Those fortunate enough to \nhave returned from the mountainside \nclaim to have seen angels in flight.\n \nFly they might, but that certainly does \nnot make them angels.\n"
"MalahGossip6"	"53\nPerhaps you have heard the accounts \nof my son's horrible death at the hands \nof Baal's minions. He was my last living \nchild...\n \nThe oath of compassion I have taken as \na healer extends only to humankind.\n \nCut them down, warrior. All of them!\n"
"MalahGossip7"	"78\nThe catapults are infernal machines \nmade of demon flesh fused with steel.\n \nBe wary of them.\n"
"MalahGossip8"	"60\nQual-Kehk is a worthy leader, but the \nlosses have borne heavily upon him. He \nis only impatient because he judges the \nworth of a warrior by action, not \nwords.\n \nYou must prove yourself worthy of his \ntrust.\n"
"MalahGossip9"	"52\nLarzuk possesses a good soul, but at \ntimes his mind seems quite unsound. \n \nHe once asked me for twenty of my \nfinest sheepskins. He said he would fill \nthem with hot air and float like a cloud \nabove the battlefield to spy on Baal's \nlegions! \n \nI worry the siege has driven him mad.\n"
"MalahGossip10"	"90\nBe cautious, warrior.\n \nThough I am an experienced healer, \nresurrection is beyond my powers.\n"
"MalahGossip11"	"53\nI pray for the day when the fields are \ncovered in snow unstained by the blood \nof our own. Perhaps that day will come \nsoon...Perhaps never...\n \nOh...But I forget myself. How may I aid \nyour quest?\n"
"MalahGossip12"	"64\nYour gold is most helpful. Medical \nsupplies for our wounded are scarce \nand very expensive.\n \nWhen we can find a supplier, oh, we \nmust pay dearly for what we need.\n"
"MalahGossip13"	"44\nWith the exception of Qual-Kehk, the \ntownspeople do not see what I see -- \nthe massacre we face.\n \nOur bravest, strongest heroes hobble \nback to me begging for help. I do what \nI can -- healing and bandaging some, \npreparing the others for what lies \nbeyond.\n"
"NihlathakAct5IntroGossip1"	"43\nWell, well. The siege has everything in \nshort supply...except fools. \n \nWhy would you seek this place, \nstranger? Are you a vulture come to \nloot the bodies of our fallen warriors? \n \nRegardless, this is no place to make a \nname for yourself. The mountain is \nours to protect. It is only a matter of \ntime before Hell's legions are routed.\n"
"NihlathakAct5IntroAssGossip1"	"54\nWell, well...An Assassin!\n \nHeh, heh...While I am sure we are all \ngrateful for your presence in our \ntroubled town, you need not have made \nthe journey.\n \nI can personally say that your skills are \nnot required here. You would serve \nyour clan better elsewhere.\n"
"NihlathakAct5IntroNecGossip1"	"45\nAhhh, a Necromancer.\n \nWhile I admire your courage in seeking \nout the darker side of magic, we really \nhave little need of your skills. The \nbattle will turn soon enough without \nyour meddling. \n \nYet, I should have expected to see your \nkind here. You are like a moth to the \nflame -- drawn to all this death. It \nfeeds you in more ways than one, does \nit not?\n"
"NihlathakGossip1"	"49\nIf you're looking for cases of \ntreacherous magic, Assassin, take a \nhard look at Larzuk. He was the only \none in town who escaped the Red Fever \nlast spring. He claimed his good \nfortune was due to 'hand washing' \nbefore meals.\n \nHmmm...Very suspicious...\n"
"NihlathakGossip2"	"48\nWhy would you seek this place, \nstranger? Are you a vulture come to \nloot the bodies of our fallen warriors? \n \nRegardless, this is no place to make a \nname for yourself.

"NihlathakGossip3"	"67\nQual-Kehk is useless. He has blindly \nsent our warriors to their deaths, \nassuming Baal's legions would fight as \nmen do. Of course, everyone knows \nthey do not.\n"
"NihlathakGossip4"	"57\nThe demon hordes have grown powerful \nbeyond measure, aided by our foolish \nmistakes. But I may have found a way \nto correct those mistakes...\n"
"NihlathakGossip5"	"37\nOh yes...I remember our warriors as \nchildren. Malah would set their broken \nbones and give them powders for their \nfevers. Now, they return to her with \nwounds that will never heal.\n \nI am tired...Please...leave me.\n"
"NihlathakGossip6"	"133\nIf you have nothing useful for me, be on \nyour way!\n"

"NihlathakGossip8"	"53\nI have long been criticized, but \nespecially of late -- since the deaths of \nmy fellow Elders. Through it all, I have \nlearned one thing. Each man must do \nwhat's right, no matter what others \nmay think.\n"

"QualKehkGossip2"	"61\nHarrogath has great need of your \npowers, noble Druid. However, in the \nface of this supernatural onslaught, \nare your natural powers up to the \ntask?\n"
"QualKehkGossip3"	"44\nThe death of Malah's son was a great \ntragedy. He was our finest archer.\n \nWhile leading a successful campaign \nagainst Baal's forces, he was impaled \non a demon's spear. The wound was \nsuch that...Well, even Malah herself \nacknowledges that quick death was a \nblessing.\n"
"QualKehkGossip4"	"57\nWe have lost many well-trained warriors \nto Baal's siege machines. Their range is \ngreat. Though, they are vulnerable if \nyou close the distance quickly enough.\n"
"QualKehkGossip5"	"96\nBaal's legions seem countless, but \nslaying their commanders takes some \nof the fight out of them.\n"
"QualKehkGossip6"	"58\nEarly on, parties of our best scouts \nwere ambushed by demons that \nspawned from the very air around \nthem. Survivors often mentioned a \nstrange creature floating in the \ndistance.\n \nPerhaps taking it down could prevent \nsome nasty surprises.\n"
"QualKehkGossip7"	"57\nThis is unlike any battle I have ever \nfought. While we ration food and \nwater, the demon hordes feast nightly \non the flesh and blood of our dead.\n"
"QualKehkGossip8"	"48\nLarzuk is a talented blacksmith, but his \nhead is full of some strange ideas. \n \nJust the other day he came to me with a \nplan to break the siege. He wanted to \nfill large pipes with exploding powders \nand steel balls, then...Well, like I said, \nstrange.\n"
"QualKehkGossip9"	"46\nOur Elders were wise leaders in more \npeaceful times, but now the survival of \nour people has fallen to me. My men \nand I will fight to the death, but there's \nno way to ensure the outcome.\n \nI used to believe that nothing could \nbreak through our guard and assault \nthe holy mountain.

"A5Q1InitLarzuk"	"45\nIf you're here to defeat Baal, you must \nprove it!\n \nAs we speak, Harrogath is under siege \nby Baal's demons.

"A5Q1EarlyReturnCain"	"105\nI understand your reluctance, but now \nis the time to strike.\n"
"A5Q1EarlyReturnAnya"	"66\nThose demons have been out there \nsince before your arrival. Can you do \nnothing to stop them?\n \nYour task is a simple one, warrior. Find \nShenk and destroy him.\n"
"A5Q1EarlyReturnMalah"	"64\nThis may not be very encouraging, but \nyou have fared better than the others \nwho passed through those gates.\n \nIn regards to Shenk the Overseer, \nremember: a general is nothing without \nhis men.\n"
"A5Q1EarlyReturnNihlathak"	"78\nWhat are you still doing here? I thought \nyou were going off to die.\n \nGo...Be quick about it.\n"
"A5Q1EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"93\nSo, you still live. You're either quick or a \ncoward.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulLarzuk"	"63\nYou're an even greater warrior than I \nexpected...Sorry for underestimating \nyou.\n \nAs a token of my appreciation, I will \ncraft sockets into an item of your \nchoosing, and from now on, you'll get \nthe best price for all my wares.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulCain"	"60\nThose catapults were like nothing I have \never seen before. You have prevailed \nagainst Shenk, my friend, but Baal is \nstill far ahead of you.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulAnya"	"108\nI was starting to wonder how long it \nwould take you to stop those beasts.\n \nGood job.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulMalah"	"94\nOh...At last, the siege is ended. You \ntruly are an angel.\n \nI thank you.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulNihlathak"	"65\nEnding the siege does not earn \nimmediate respect, outsider.\n \nRespect only comes with sacrifice -- \nsomething I'm sure you know nothing \nof.\n"
"A5Q1SuccessfulQualKehk"	"68\nSo...You managed to stop the siege.\n \nYou are more powerful than I gave you \ncredit for. You have rightfully earned \nmy respect.\n"
"A5Q2InitQualKehk"	"58\nMy concerns have turned to my men \ntaken prisoner on the battlefield by \nBaal's demons. I hate to think what's \nhappened to them.\n \nAs you journey up the mountain, keep \nyour eyes open for my soldiers and \nbring them back to me if you can.\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitQualKehk"	"85\nThose of my men fortunate enough to \nescape on their own told me that they \nwere held captive in the highlands and \nplateaus.\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitCain"	"74\nI know firsthand that captivity is a sad \nfate for a man. Find them quickly.\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitAnya"	"85\nIf those men are being treated like I \nwas, you must find them. They won't \nsurvive much longer.\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitLarzuk"	"73\nI crafted the swords and armor for \nQual-Kehk's men. They were like \nbrothers to me. I can't imagine the pain \nthey must be suffering.\n \nSave them if you can!\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitMalah"	"84\nQual-Kehk's men have been imprisoned \nfor some time. They are certain to be \ntired and weak.\n \nYou must protect them once you free \nthem.\n"
"A5Q2AfterInitNihlathak"	"94\nYou have proven you can take life, \nwarrior, but can you save it as well?\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"95\nThey say that discretion, not \nprocrastination, is the better part of \nvalor.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnQualKehkMan"	"78\nMore of my men are still alive out there. \nI am certain of it!\n \nFind them. Free them from their cages \nand bring them back to me.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnCain"	"63\nIf you are having trouble finding \nQual-Kehk's soldiers, you should talk to \nMalah. She healed those who made it \nback before. Perhaps she would have \nsome advice.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnAnya"	"115\nWell, you found me on the mountain; I'm \nsure you'll find them too.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnLarzuk"	"76\nAs a kid, I used to play soldier among \nthe barricades on the mountain. \nThere's no easy way through that maze \nof walls.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnMalah"	"67\nSoldiers who made it back told of a \nsystem of barricades placed among the \nmountain passes. They said that is \nwhere the prisoners are held.\n"
"A5Q2EarlyReturnNihlathak"	"52\nDid you ever stop to think why these \ndemons are capturing Qual-Kehk's \nmen? Why they are attacking us? Have \nyou considered what Baal wants with \nthe mountain?\n \nNo. You've not. You have no idea what \nyou are dealing with.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulQualKehk"	"51\nThank you for rescuing my men. They \nhave spoken well of your bravery in \nbattle. Perhaps there is hope for us \nafter all. \n \nIf you wish, you may hire some of my \nmercenaries that you saved. And \nplease...take this set of runes. I had \nbeen saving them for a socketed shield, \nbut I think you'll make better use of \nthem.\n \nBe sure to set them in the right order \nfor their fullest effect.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulCain"	"80\nYou've become a hero to this town, my \nfriend. The shadows have lifted ever \nsince you brought the Light to \nHarrogath.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulAnya"	"107\nI'm sure those men appreciate the \nfreedom you gave them...as much as I \ndo.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulLarzuk"	"55\nSince your arrival, Cain has spoken of \nyour deeds in the Southern Kingdoms, \ndefeating both Mephisto and Diablo. At \nfirst, I scoffed at his tales, but I'm \nfinding them more believable with every \npassing day.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulMalah"	"73\nYou have inspired the people in this \ntown -- not only those you rescued, but \nthose you've helped in other ways as \nwell.\n"
"A5Q2SuccessfulNihlathak"	"72\nSo. You brought the lost sheep home to \nthe shepherd. Well done.\n"
"A5Q3InitMalah"	"43\nThere is a matter which I hesitate to \nshare, but I believe you are the only \none who can help me now.\n \nAnya, the young alchemist and \ndaughter to one of our slain Elders, \nhas been missing for some time. She is \na strong, crafty woman with a spirit \nlike no other.\n \nOne night, just before your arrival, I \noverheard her and Nihlathak arguing \nabout her father's death. The next \nmorning she was gone.\n \nNihlathak has his own tale as to where \nshe went and why. Don't believe him! I \nfear he is at the root of her \ndisappearance.\n \nPlease, if you can, search for Anya and \nbring her back to us. She'll know what \nto do about Nihlathak.\n"
"A5Q3AfterInitMalah"	"94\nWhen you talk to Nihlathak, be careful. \nThere is no telling what he will say or \ndo.\n"
"A5Q3AfterInitCain"	"59\nI would listen to Malah. Nihlathak \nspeaks with a venomous tongue and \nacts as if the entire weight of this town \nrests upon his shoulders.\n \nPerhaps there is more going on here \nthan we know.\n"
"A5Q3AfterInitLarzuk"	"57\nAnya is an amazing alchemist, \nespecially for her young age. As long \nas I've known her, she's never let \nanything stop her from pursuing what \nshe believed in. \n \nI wouldn't doubt that Nihlathak is \ninvolved. Ever since her father died, \nthey haven't gotten along.\n"
"A5Q3AfterInitNihlathak"	"41\nAnya! Who have you been talking to? \nLikely it was that meddling Malah. \n \nWell, I'll tell you what really happened. \nAnya came to me for guidance, after \nreceiving a vision that her mother and \nyounger brother were trapped in the \nlands beyond the Ice Caves. She had \ndecided to go rescue them. \n \nI told her that her quest was a foolish \none and that she would be safer \nstaying within the city walls. However, \nshe is a willful girl and would not listen \nto me. \n \nThe next morning, she was gone. No \none is more distraught than I over \nlosing her. \n \nHowever, if you feel the need to be \nMalah's errand child, I won't try to stop \nyou.\n"
"A5Q3AfterInitQualKehk"	"43\nAnya's father, Aust, was our wisest \nElder. He was killed along with the \nother Elders who erected the ward that \nprotects this city. The ward has kept \nBaal's demons out of Harrogath, but at \na costly sacrifice. \n \nNihlathak, on the other hand, was the \nonly Elder to escape the demons. \nSomehow, he alone managed to find \nsanctuary, while the others died \naround him.\n \nEver since that day, Nihlathak and Anya \nhave been at odds.\n"
"A5Q3EarlyReturnMalah"	"52\nIf it were anyone else, I would assume \nher dead. However, Anya is not so \neasily beaten. I know she must be alive.\n"
"A5Q3EarlyReturnCain"	"60\nNihlathak's story does sound \nreasonable, considering what I've \nheard about Anya. However, the best \nlies are often hidden within truth.\n"
"A5Q3EarlyReturnLarzuk"	"56\nAs the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is \nthe only person, besides Nihlathak, \nwho has any real knowledge of Mount \nArreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our \nfate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.\n"
"A5Q3EarlyReturnNihlathak"	"46\nLook, I've told you! She's dead! If you \nknew what was good for you, you'd \nconcentrate your efforts on saving \nHarrogath -- not on lost causes like \nAnya.\n"
"A5Q3EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"81\nIt seems like everyone feels Nihlathak \nplayed a part in Anya's disappearance.\n \nWhy would he do such a thing?\n"
"A5Q3FoundAnyaMalah"	"56\nSo! That snake Nihlathak was behind \nAnya's disappearance...and he trapped \nher with a freezing curse.\n \nHere. Take this potion to Anya and give \nit to her. That should release her.\n"
"A5Q3FoundAnyaCain"	"54\nGoodness! Anya frozen by that fallen \nBarbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah \ncan help you where I cannot.\n"
"A5Q3FoundAnyaLarzuk"	"80\nPoor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak \nwas a traitor...\n \nIf you find him alive, kill him for me!\n"
"A5Q3FoundAnyaQualKehk"	"70\nThe snake has slipped our grasp! While \nyou were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.\n \nI'll bet Anya knows how to track him \ndown.\n"
"A5Q3FoundAnyaAnya"	"50\nHero. Nihlathak did this to me!\n \nIf you've come to help me, my only hope \nlies with Malah.\n \nPlease...Tell her you've found me...\n"
"A5Q3SuccessfulMalah"	"48\nThank you so much for bringing Anya \nback to us. I have devised this spell to \nincrease your resistances as a token of \nmy thanks. I know it isn't much, but I \nhope you find it helpful.\n \nPlease go talk to Anya. She has urgent \nnews concerning Nihlathak.\n"
"A5Q3SuccessfulCain"	"62\nFor one so young, Anya commands \ngreat respect. Now that she is here, I \nwill make it a point to talk to her about \nMount Arreat.\n \nYou should do the same.\n"
"A5Q3SuccessfulLarzuk"	"67\nI never liked Nihlathak, but I never \nsuspected that he'd betray us! I just \ncan't understand how an Elder could do \nsuch a thing.\n"
"A5Q3SuccessfulQualKehk"	"140\nYour rescue of Anya was quite an \naccomplishment.\n"
"A5Q3SuccessfulAnya"	"80\nThank you, hero, for rescuing me.\n \nTo show my personal gratitude, I give \nyou this. I had it custom-made for you \nby Larzuk.\n"
"A5Q4InitAnya"	"43\nNihlathak told me he struck a deal with \nBaal to protect Harrogath. In exchange \nfor the demon's mercy, the misguided \nfool plans to give Baal the Relic of the \nAncients, our most holy totem!\n \nDoing so will allow Baal to enter Mount \nArreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I \ntried to stop Nihlathak, but he \nimprisoned me in that icy tomb.\n \nNihlathak must be stopped before he \ndooms the whole world. As much as I \nwould love to strangle the life out of \nhim, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.\n \nYou must go to his lair through this \nportal I've opened, kill him, and then \nbring back the Relic of the Ancients.\n \nStop Nihlathak from destroying what we \nhave striven for eons to protect.\n"
"A5Q4AfterInitAnya"	"90\nAs noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, \nnothing can excuse his actions.\n"
"A5Q4AfterInitCain"	"50\nRegretfully, I know very little about this \nRelic. However, if what the others say \nis true, then Baal must not gain \npossession of it.\n \nStop Nihlathak...before all is lost.\n"
"A5Q4AfterInitMalah"	"65\nMy worst fear has come true. Nihlathak \nhas gone mad.\n \nYou must stop him, before he gives the \nRelic to the Lord of Destruction!\n"
"A5Q4AfterInitLarzuk"	"56\nNow, rescuing Anya -- that's good. \nTalking to me while Nihlathak hands \nover the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad!\n"
"A5Q4AfterInitQualKehk"	"60\nI saw Nihlathak leave town just before \nyou found Anya. He must be held \naccountable for his criminal deeds.\n \nFind him and bring him back, if you can. \nLikely, he won't come willingly, and \nyou'll be forced to kill him.\n \nSo be it.\n"
"A5Q4EarlyReturnAnya"	"55\nNihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the \nRelic, he shall enter the mountain and \nwreak havoc there!\n \nI cannot believe that Nihlathak would \ngive the Relic to Baal in any kind of \ntrade. He's truly insane if he believes \nthat he can deal with the Lord of \nDestruction.\n"
"A5Q4EarlyReturnCain"	"58\nOhh...This is a truly horrible turn of \nevents.\n \nI know it seems you have always been \none step behind, my friend. But look at \nit this way...You have evil on the run.\n"
"A5Q4EarlyReturnLarzuk"	"160\n...What's there to talk about?\n \nKill Nihlathak!\n"
"A5Q4EarlyReturnMalah"	"63\nNihlathak was never the kindest man. \nBut for him to betray the whole world...\n \nAhh...Where shall his soul finally rest?\n"
"A5Q4EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"65\nMy advice is to go in quick and hit hard. \nNihlathak can't be half as tough as the \nbeasts you've faced out there.\n"
"A5Q4SuccessfulAnya"	"55\nYou have stopped Nihlathak, but he \ndidn't have the Relic! He must have \nalready given it to Baal. Now, Baal will \nnot be tested when he reaches Arreat's \nsummit.\n \n...Damn Nihlathak!\n \nI do thank you for trying, though. \nPlease, allow me to honor your courage \nby magically inscribing your name onto \nan item of your choosing. It's the least \nI can do.\n"
"A5Q4SuccessfulCain"	"90\nBeware! Baal grows stronger with every \npassing moment.\n"
"A5Q4SuccessfulLarzuk"	"93\nHmmm...What does Baal plan to do \ninside Mount Arreat?\n"
"A5Q4SuccessfulMalah"	"65\nSo, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on \nfailures past. It is your future that \nmatters more.\n"
"A5Q4SuccessfulQualKehk"	"57\nNihlathak was a vile demon that shall \nfind his home among the tortured \nminions of Hell!\n \nYou battled the Darkness without fear. I \nlaud your skill and courage.\n"
"A5Q5InitQualKehk"	"37\nEvery time I hear of you, warrior, your \ndeeds become more legendary.\n \nBut take heed. You are approaching the \nvery summit of Mount Arreat. I have \nnever dared venture there. It is sacred \n-- our most holy place. The legends say \nit is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who \nblock the path of all who are unworthy.\n \nYour reputation here does not \nmatter...It will be the Ancients who \ndetermine your worthiness.\n \nGood luck.\n"
"A5Q5AfterInitQualKehk"	"63\nThe Ancients are not our enemies. \nRemember that! They are our \nancestors -- our gods.\n"
"A5Q5AfterInitCain"	"90\nA test of mettle is a fitting rite of \npassage for a Barbarian hero.\n"
"A5Q5AfterInitAnya"	"72\nYou wouldn't have to test yourself \nagainst the Ancients if it weren't for \nNihlathak's treachery. He was a fool \nand deserves to suffer for eternity.\n"
"A5Q5AfterInitLarzuk"	"75\nEvery night, I've prayed to the Ancients \nto bring us peace...and now you must \nfight them.\n \nHuh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior?\n"
"A5Q5AfterInitMalah"	"65\nBy reaching the summit, you cease \nbeing just a simple warrior. When you \ncome back, you will be far more.\n"
"A5Q5EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"114\nI warned you!\n \nThe Ancients are not like the demons \nyou're accustomed to fighting.\n"
"A5Q5EarlyReturnCain"	"52\nWe have come too far to be defeated \nnow, my friend. I have seen you \ncomplete many difficult quests. Though \nthis may be your greatest trial, it is not \nbeyond your reach.\n"
"A5Q5EarlyReturnAnya"	"71\nLook. I must apologize.\n \nI feel responsible for your current \nstruggle. If I had only stopped \nNihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, \nyou would not have to fight those \nghosts.\n"
"A5Q5EarlyReturnLarzuk"	"70\nYou've walked on the burial grounds of \nour greatest ancestors. I'm not sure \nwhether I should bow before you or \nrevile you for committing sacrilege.\n \nTread lightly when you walk with gods.\n"
"A5Q5EarlyReturnMalah"	"68\nDo not doubt yourself. I believe you are \nworthy to pass through the Ancients' \ngates, but you must believe, as well.\n"
"A5Q5SuccessfulQualKehk"	"75\nBesting the Ancients in battle is a \nmighty feat indeed. I hope this means \nyou're ready to battle Baal.\n"
"A5Q5SuccessfulCain"	"67\nYou have proven yourself to these \npeople. They look to you as their \nwarrior, their champion.\n"
"A5Q5SuccessfulAnya"	"82\nYou stand before me a worthy hero -- \nand on you rests the last hope of our \npeople.\n \nBear it well, warrior.\n"
"A5Q5SuccessfulLarzuk"	"82\nThe Ancients have honored you, and in \nturn, so do we. I have no remaining \ndoubts about you, now.\n"
"A5Q5SuccessfulMalah"	"60\nI knew the Ancients would find you \nworthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, \nstop Baal before he destroys all that is \nsacred.\n"
"A5Q6InitAncients"	"31\nYou are a worthy hero! We augment \nyour skill and grant you entry to the \ninterior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies \nthe Worldstone.\n \nBeware. You will not be alone. Baal the \nLord of Destruction is already inside. \n \nThe Archangel Tyrael has always been \nour benefactor, but even he cannot \nhelp us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's \nspiritual presence from entering the \nchamber of the Worldstone. Only you, \nmortal, have the power to defeat Baal \nnow.\n \nBaal threatens the Worldstone -- and \nthrough it, the mortal realm, itself. You \nmust stop him before he gains full \ncontrol of the sacred stone. With it \nunder his control, Baal could shatter \nthe boundaries between this world and \nthe Burning Hells, thus allowing the \nhordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth \ninto the mortal realm like an \nunstoppable tide!\n \nIf you are weak, the world as you know \nit could be lost forever. You must NOT \nfail!\n"
"A5Q6EarlyReturnCain"	"51\nRemember this. Baal once possessed Tal \nRasha, one of the most powerful of the \nancient Horadrim.\n \nYour battles with Mephisto and Diablo \nwill pale in comparison to your battle \nwith Baal.\n \nThe Lord of Destruction aided by Tal \nRasha's knowledge...The mountain \nitself will tremble when you clash.\n"
"A5Q6EarlyReturnLarzuk"	"59\nI may be just an armorer, but I know \nthis...Baal plans to destroy the world \nwith the secrets contained in that \nmountain. It doesn't take a genius to \nknow he has to be stopped.\n"
"A5Q6EarlyReturnMalah"	"70\nYou knew it would eventually come down \nto this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!\n"
"A5Q6EarlyReturnAnya"	"60\nBaal has blocked Tyrael from entering \nthe Worldstone Chamber? This truly \nhas become a battle against Hell.\n \nWhether or not it was the Heavens' \ndecree, this is your fight now -- your \ndestiny.\n"
"A5Q6EarlyReturnQualKehk"	"63\nYou have ventured to a place beyond \nlegend. You rush to face an evil few \ncan even imagine.\n \nBe careful, my friend, and may the Light \nwatch over you.\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulTyrael"	"40\nI am impressed, mortal. You have \novercome the greatest challenge this \nworld has ever faced and defeated the \nlast of the Prime Evils. However, we are \ntoo late to save the Worldstone. Baal's \ndestructive touch has corrupted it \ncompletely.\n \nGiven enough time, the Worldstone's \nenergies will drain away and the \nbarriers between the worlds will \nshatter -- the powers of Hell will flood \ninto this...Sanctuary...and eradicate \nyour people and everything you've \nlabored to build.\n \nTherefore, I must destroy the corrupted \nWorldstone before the powers of Hell \ntake root. This act will change your \nworld forever -- with consequences \neven I cannot foresee. However, it is \nthe only way to ensure mankind's \nsurvival.\n \nGo now, mortal. I have opened a portal \nthat will lead you to safety.\n \nMay the Eternal Light shine upon you \nand your descendants for what you've \ndone this day. The continued survival \nof mankind is your legacy! Above all \nelse, you have earned a rest from this \nendless battle.\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulAnya"	"53\nYou have done the impossible, hero. \nYour defeat of the last of the three \nPrime Evils is a great victory for the \nLight. \n \nStrange that you say that the \nWorldstone must be destroyed. The \nprophecies said nothing about that.\n \nPerhaps all we have fought for will be \nlost...or perhaps we'll never need fight \nagain!\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulCain"	"40\nI knew in time you would defeat Baal. \nYou have done everything you set out \nto do, my friend.\n \nEver since you rescued me from \nTristram, I have believed in you. It has \nbeen a supreme honor to aid you along \nthe way. \n \nSo...The Worldstone was corrupted by \nBaal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. \nWorry not. Through whatever lies \nahead I have faith that the Light will \nguide us both.\n \nGo, now, back to the Worldstone \nchamber, and enter the portal Tyrael \nhas opened for you.\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulLarzuk"	"74\nThe Ancients themselves will envy our \nsongs about you.\n \nPlease, don't forget about us! Farewell, \nmy friend.\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulMalah"	"48\nIf Tyrael says the Worldstone must be \ndestroyed, then it must. We cannot let \nBaal's corruption prevail!\n \nThe world will change, true -- but who is \nto say it isn't for the better?\n"
"A5Q6SuccessfulQualKehk"	"60\nThe destruction of the Worldstone does \nnot bode well for our world. But I'll try \nnot to worry...\n \nAfter all, we have warriors like you \nfighting for us and for the Light.\n \nFarewell!\n"
