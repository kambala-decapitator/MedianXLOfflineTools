# you can change the order to your liking
# empty lines and text after '#' are ignored unless the character is escaped \#
# do NOT change file encoding (it's Latin1 aka ISO 8859-1)

# types containing . are treated as regular expression
gem.  # gem  (hardcoded ordering: cLOD - MXL)
rune  # rune (hardcoded ordering: cLOD - MXL - Great - Ultimative)
asaa  # MO   (hardcoded ordering: any - armor - ring/amulet - weapon)
asa\# # UMO (backslash is intended; sorting order same as MO)
ara.  # class charm (regular expression)
char  # charm
cycl  # cycle
poti  # signet, moon symbol, apple
hpot  # elixir, goodberry, healing potion
mpot  # mana potion

# next comes a special block of items which can be reordered only 'internally',
# i.e. you can reorder only types inside the 'thng' block.
# types inside the block are indented with tab, don't break the indentation please.
# not all 'thng' items are present in the list: feel free to add more from thng_list.txt file.
# string is interpreted as a regular expression, just escape # characters with \# (see UMO for exmaple)
# you can separate multiple regular expressions for one group of items with |  (see trophy for example)
