- search and fix all 'TODO:' in code

v0.3:
- creation of plugy stashes and moving items around
- export item to bbcode/html
- generate some bbcode/html report about character and/or plugy stashes contents
- mass disenchant (dialog and multiple selection) - if not too time consuming

future versions:
- new data structure for items - QMap with item storage as a key
- sort stashes
- affix rlvl (and maybe names - then modify help text) support
- items drag & drop
- merc & corpse items
- nice display of property 'Adds x-y ... damage'
- unsocket items
- show UMO properties
- try unMO UMOs
- calculate correct str/dex bonus based on character stats
- display actual stat values
- display skill tree
- skills allocation
- item requirements
- when reloading character, explicitly reload shared stashes that were modified
