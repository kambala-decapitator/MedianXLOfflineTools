"WarrivAct1IntroGossip1"	"45\nGreetings, stranger. I'm not surprised \nto see your kind here. Many \nadventurers have traveled this way \nsince the recent troubles began.\n \nNo doubt you've heard about the \ntragedy that befell the town of \nTristram. Some say that Diablo, the \nLord of Terror, walks the world again.\n \nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark \nWanderer did travel this route a few \nweeks ago. He was headed east to the \nmountain pass guarded by the Rogue \nMonastery.\n \nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to \nhave trailed in his wake. You see, \nshortly after the Wanderer went \nthrough, the Monastery's Gates to the \npass were closed and strange \ncreatures began ravaging the \ncountryside.\n \nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the \ngates are re-opened, I'll remain here \nwith my caravan. I hope to leave for \nLut Gholein before the shadow that fell \nover Tristram consumes us all. If \nyou're still alive then, I'll take you \nalong.\n \nYou should talk to Akara, too. She \nseems to be the leader of this camp. \nMaybe she can tell you more.\n"
"WarrivAct1IntroPalGossip1"	"45\nWell met, noble Paladin. It's been a \nwhile since I've seen any of your kind in \nthe west. It would be an honor to aid \nyou in any way that I can.\n \nNo doubt you've heard about the \ntragedy that befell the town of \nTristram. Some say that Diablo, the \nLord of Terror, walks the world again.\n \nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark \nWanderer did travel this route a few \nweeks ago.

She \nseems to be the leader of this camp. \nMaybe she can tell you more.\n"
"WarrivGossip1"	"51\nI've been leading my trade caravan \nacross the eastern deserts for more \nthan twenty years now. I've been \nattacked by bandits and outlaws more \ntimes than I can remember. But never \nwhen a Paladin accompanied me. \n \nIndeed, your Order has saved me from \nlosing a small fortune over the years. I \njust hope you can discover what's \ngoing on around here and get the \nGates to the East opened up!\n"
"WarrivGossip2"	"85\nCain seems to have great wisdom \nregarding the supernatural. I hope I \nnever live to be that wise...\n"
"WarrivGossip3"	"58\nAkara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She \nsells the few magic items in her \npossession and can even heal your \nwounds. She is very wise and will help \nyou if she can.\n"
"WarrivGossip4"	"66\nThe fiery Kashya commands the Rogue \narchers in battle. I've only spoken to \nher a few times, though. I get the \nfeeling that she doesn't like outsiders \nvery much.\n"
"WarrivGossip5"	"88\nCharsi seems to be a very sweet girl. \nShe's the smith around here and can \nhelp you by trading weapons and \narmor.\n"
"WarrivGossip6"	"55\nGheed is a wandering merchant of \nquestionable character who is traveling \nalong with my caravan to the East. He \nwill buy and sell most anything.\n \nHe's greedy, but his wares are beyond \nreproach. I would suggest keeping both \neyes open when you deal with him.\n"
"WarrivGossip7"	"71\nTo the east are lands of great \nmystery... and the Jewel City of the \nDesert, Lut Gholein.\n"
"WarrivGossip8"	"68\nI'll gladly take you eastward, if you can \ndrive the Evil from the Monastery. \nThen, the Rogues may re-open the pass \nthrough the mountains.\n"
"WarrivGossip9"	"70\nIt's easy to become lost in the \nwilderness on the way to the Citadel. \nAfter you have come to the Cairn \nStones, you must remember that the \npath continues through the caves.\n"
"AkaraIntroGossip1"	"35\nI am Akara, High Priestess of the \nSisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I \nwelcome you, traveler, to our camp, \nbut I'm afraid I can offer you but poor \nshelter within these rickety walls.\n \nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has \nfallen under a strange curse. The \nmighty Citadel from which we have \nguarded the gates to the East for \ngenerations, has been corrupted by the \nevil Demoness, Andariel.\n \nI still can't believe it... but she turned \nmany of our sister Rogues against us \nand drove us from our ancestral home. \nNow the last defenders of the \nSisterhood are either dead or scattered \nthroughout the wilderness.\n \nI implore you, stranger. Please help us. \nFind a way to lift this terrible curse and \nwe will pledge our loyalty to you for all \ntime.\n"
"AkaraIntroSorGossip1"	"34\nGreetings, young Sorceress. It is good \nto see more of your kind at work in the \nworld these dark days. In my opinion, \nthe world needs more women to fight \nagainst the great shadow. But I am \nforgetting my manners... \n \nI am Akara, High Priestess of the \nSisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I \nwelcome you, traveler, to our camp, \nbut I'm afraid I can offer you but poor \nshelter within these rickety walls.\n \nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has \nfallen under a strange curse. The \nmighty Citadel from which we have \nguarded the gates to the East for \ngenerations, has been corrupted by the \nevil Demoness, Andariel.\n \nI still can't believe it... but she turned \nmany of our sister Rogues against us \nand drove us from our ancestral home. \nNow the last defenders of the \nSisterhood are either dead or scattered \nthroughout the wilderness.\n \nI implore you, stranger: please help us. \nFind a way to lift this terrible curse and \nwe will pledge our loyalty to you for all \ntime.\n"
"AkaraGossip1"	"42\nThe Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has \na long and distinguished history. Over \nthe generations our Order has become \na deadly fighting force as well as a \nbastion for women who sought to forge \ntheir own destiny.\n \nYet beware, young one, the lure of \npower and knowledge can lead to \ndisaster. I have seen ambition foul the \nbravest of hearts and recklessness dull \nhard-won wisdom.\n \nYou would do well to tread lightly upon \nthe dark path you have chosen to \nexplore.\n"
"AkaraGossip2"	"49\nI understand that Cain is the last \ndescendant of the ancient Horadrim \nand that his knowledge of their lore is \nvast. He could prove to be very useful \nin discerning the nature of our current \ncrisis.\n"
"AkaraGossip3"	"49\nKashya has always been fiercely loyal, \nbut I fear her anger and frustration \nover these recent events will lead her \ninto harm's way. She is highly \nprotective of the few Rogues remaining \nunder her command and will not send \nthem into combat unless there is dire \nneed.\n"
"AkaraGossip4"	"46\nCharsi is young and innocent. However, \nI believe her Barbarian blood thrills to \nthe prospect of adventure and danger. \nShe takes great pride in her work and \nfinds comfort in the fact that her \nweapons and armor are helping to end \nthis evil plague.\n"
"AkaraGossip5"	"48\nThough he has only been our guest for \na short time, I sense that Warriv has \nfaced many harrowing trials. Though \nhe knows, as I do, that a terrible evil \nhas blanketed the land, his only real \nconcern is to reach the eastern trading \nports with his caravan.\n"
"AkaraGossip6"	"53\nTo be honest, I have done my best to \nstay clear of Gheed. He wears \ndishonesty about himself like a cloak \nand seeks only to better his situation \nby preying on the misfortunes of \nothers.\n"
"AkaraGossip7"	"55\nThe wilderness is overrun with Evil and \nthe minions of Hell have taken our \nrightful home. We must purge all Evil \nfrom the Monastery and restore order \nto the world.\n"
"AkaraGossip8"	"53\nI often dream of the day we reclaim our \nown. The Sightless Eye sees through \nthe mist of time a great glory ahead, \nbut how far ahead the Eye cannot \ndiscern.\n"
"AkaraGossip9"	"67\nOur mental discipline is matched only by \nour skill in archery... I only hope these \nare enough to withstand this awful \ntrial.\n"
"AkaraGossip10"	"59\nBeware that you do not suffer the fate \nof the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's \nlife is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul \nis even worse.\n"
"AkaraGossip11"	"41\nEven though the corrupted ones were \nonce of our Order, you need not shy \nfrom slaying them, for they stand \nbetween you and Andariel.\n \nPerhaps, when the Demon Queen is \ndead, our Sisters will return to life, but \nmore likely they will be forever bound \nto their unholy pact.\n"
"KashyaIntroGossip1"	"56\nWelcome, outlander, to our glorious \nhovel. I know you're here to challenge \nthe evil that's driven us from our \nancestral home.\n \nBut, know this. Akara may be our \nspiritual leader, but I command the \nRogues in battle. It will take more than \njust killing a few beasts in the \nwilderness to earn my trust.\n"
"KashyaIntroAmaGossip1"	"55\nWell, well, I never expected to see an \nAmazon in these lands. You're very \nbrave to have come here. Many of my \nfellow Sisters have fallen under some \ndark spell, and if you're not careful you \nmay fall prey to it as well.\n"
"KashyaGossip1"	"60\nWhen I was very young, Akara told me \ntales of the Amazons' fearlessness in \nbattle and of their skills with spears \nand bows. I like to think we Rogues \nhave much in common with you \nAmazons.\n"
"KashyaGossip2"	"64\nSome of my Rogues told me of Deckard \nCain. They said that he is a man of \ngreat wisdom. Personally, I don't know \nhow wise he could possibly be if he \nnever learned how to wage battle \nhimself.\n"
"KashyaGossip3"	"57\nAkara has been like a mother to me for \nas long as I can remember. She is wise \nand good, but I don't think she has the \nsteel to retake our Monastery by force.\n"
"KashyaGossip4"	"89\nI don't trust many outlanders, but \nWarriv seems fine. He never says much \nto me, though.\n"
"KashyaGossip5"	"66\nBefore our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith, \ncould fashion any implement of war.\n \nHere in the camp, she merely makes do. \nHer best tools remain within the \nMonastery.\n"
"KashyaGossip6"	"58\nGheed is a pig. I've been tempted to \nthrow him out of the camp many times, \nbut Charsi seems to think that he's \ngood company. I don't trust the man, \nbut if she's comforted by him, then I'll \ndesist.\n"
"KashyaGossip7"	"76\nIf we could only find out how Andariel \nhas managed to corrupt our Sisters, \nthen, perhaps, we could drive out the \nevil clouding their minds.\n"
"KashyaGossip8"	"68\nIn this camp, those of us who have \nremained true to our Order are forced \nto live among common traders and \nfarm animals.\n \nWelcome to our circle of suffering.\n"
"KashyaGossip9"	"67\nPerhaps Tristram deserved its fate... \nfor letting Evil loose upon the land. I \nonly hope we don't suffer the same.\n"
"KashyaGossip10"	"71\nSome evenings we gather at the bonfire \nto retell epic tales... and try to forget \nabout the terrible events that led to \nlosing the Monastery.\n"
"CharsiIntroGossip1"	"47\nHi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here \nin camp. It's good to see some strong \nadventurers around here.\n \nMany of our Sisters fought bravely \nagainst Diablo when he first attacked \nthe town of Tristram. They came back \nto us true veterans, bearing some \nreally powerful items. Seems like their \nvictory was short-lived, though... Most \nof them are now corrupted by Andariel.\n"
"CharsiIntroBarGossip1"	"54\nWow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's \nreally great to meet you. I've seen a \nfew of your kind around here lately. I'm \na little jealous... I wish I could go off \nadventuring with you.\n \nOh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the \nblacksmith here in camp.\n"
"CharsiGossip1"	"57\nYou know, I've been with the Sisters for \nas long as I can remember. But Akara \ntold me that my real parents were \nBarbarians from the northern tribes \nand that they were killed when I was \nvery young.\n \nSometimes I wonder what my life would \nhave been like if I had been raised as a \nBarbarian.\n \nI don't know. I love being a blacksmith... \nbut sometimes I just want to get out \nand explore the world, you know?\n"
"CharsiGossip2"	"86\nI don't really know anything about Cain. \nHe seems to have a lot of secrets... \nThat makes me nervous.\n"
"CharsiGossip3"	"51\nOh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a \nlittle hard on outsiders, but who can \nblame her? All she wants is to protect \nour Order. But now that our Sisters \nhave turned against us... I think this \nwhole mess has hardened her heart.\n"
"CharsiGossip4"	"64\nAkara, our priestess and seer, is most \nupset by the corruption of our Sisters. \nI fear that she blames herself.\n"
"CharsiGossip5"	"80\nWarriv's all right, I guess. He seems too \nserious most of the time. I haven't \nreally talked to him all that much.\n"
"CharsiGossip6"	"60\nOh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He \nhas all sorts of interesting stories from \nthe places he's been. I wish I could see \nthe sights he has.\n"
"CharsiGossip7"	"84\nI don't know why some of my Sisters \nchose to follow Andariel. Those who \nstrayed were among our finest \nwarriors.\n"
"GheedIntroGossip1"	"48\nGood day to you partner! I'm Gheed and \nI can already tell that I'll be your best \nfriend in this forsaken camp.\n \nA spare weapon, some gold, a small \ngem is all I want in exchange for the \nequipment you'll need on whatever \nquests you might undertake.\n \nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my \nitems are guaranteed for life and come \nwith a two-day warranty!\n"
"GheedIntroNecGossip1"	"46\nA Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have \nto lay my eyes on one of your kind \nagain. ... The recent troubles in this \narea have brought out all kinds, I see. \nNevertheless, your money's good...\n \nA spare weapon, some gold, a small \ngem is all I want in exchange for the \nequipment you'll need on whatever \nquests you might undertake!\n \nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my \nitems are guaranteed for life and come \nwith a two-day warranty!\n"
"GheedGossip1"	"74\nDon't think you can fool me, \nNecromancer. I've seen what your kind \ncan do. If you're involved in any of the \nevil out there, I don't even want to \nknow. Trade quickly and be about your \nbusiness!\n"
"GheedGossip2"	"57\nThat old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet \nQuill Rat. I hear he survived whatever \nhappened in Tristram. Personally, I \nwouldn't trust a thing he has to say.\n"
"GheedGossip3"	"55\nAkara and Kashya are Sisters in the \nOrder of the Sightless Eye, but they are \nworlds apart. Akara is a slow river of \nmagic, and Kashya, a viper of war. \nThey're both deeply devoted to their \nreligious order, yet the corruption of \ntheir Sisters pains them both to no \nend.\n"
"GheedGossip4"	"52\nCharsi is a fine girl..., but she has no \nbusiness savvy! I know she means well, \nbut the prices she charges for weapons \nand armor will never earn her a profit.\n \nAs long as I keep filling her mind with \nstories of adventure, she'll never catch \non to the fact that I'm raking in gold \nhand over fist!\n"
"GheedGossip5"	"55\nWarriv was kind enough to let me travel \nwith his caravan, but don't let him drag \nyou into a search for a new Eastern \ntrade route.\n \nI'm making a fortune right here... from \nthe Rogues, of course! You, on the \nother hand, always get my best prices!\n"
"GheedGossip6"	"61\nAndariel's demonic forces have taken up \nresidence in the forests as well as the \nMonastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing \nout of the camp. So, if you need \nanything, I'll be right here.\n"
"GheedGossip7"	"58\nWhen - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm \ngoing to find the largest bowl of \nNarlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly \nsense has left my body.\n"
"CainGossip1"	"43\nLong ago, the Soulstones were given to \nthe Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. \nThey were used to bind the three Prime \nEvils. I now know that even these holy \nartifacts were no match for Diablo's \npower.\n \nI hope that his two brothers are more \nsecurely held... but I fear the worst.\n"
"CainGossip2"	"54\nIt takes time to master your skills... and \nuse will hone your technique. But take \ncare to choose your new skills wisely.\n"
"CainGossip3"	"52\nYou may recover some mysterious \nthings from the demons you kill. Some \nof great use to you... some of great \nperil! Bring them to me and I'll reveal \ntheir secrets.\n"
"CainGossip4"	"46\nHave I told you about the Horadrim? \nThey were an ancient confederation of \nmage-clans who sought to bind the \nthree Prime Evils for eternity. The \nHoradrim are now nearly forgotten... \nand it appears that the bonds they \nwove are unravelling!\n \nAs the last of the Horadrim, I pray that \nI can help you remedy their failure.\n"
"CainGossip5"	"43\nLong ago, Diablo and his brothers were \ncast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It \nseems that Hell's balance has shifted, \nas Andariel is now aligned with the \nLord of Terror. Her presence here in \nthe mortal realm does not bode well for \nus.\n"
"RogueSignpostGossip1"	"90\nTurn back! I can tell that you need more \nexperience to fight safely in the next \nwilderness.\n"
"RogueSignpostGossip2"	"46\nHalt! You should complete Akara's quest \nbefore venturing further. Search for \nthe Den in the wilderness closer to \ncamp.\n"
"RogueSignpostGossip3"	"116\nBeware! The evil is strong ahead.\n"
"RogueSignpostGossip4"	"92\nBeware! Beyond lies mortal danger for \nthe likes of you!\n"
"RogueSignpostGossip5"	"88\nTake care! The Corrupted Rogues in the \nwilderness ahead are not to be trifled \nwith.\n"
"A1Q1InitAkara"	"43\nThere is a place of great evil in the \nwilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts \nhave informed me that a cave nearby is \nfilled with shadowy creatures and \nhorrors from beyond the grave.\n \nI fear that these creatures are massing \nfor an attack against our encampment. \nIf you are sincere about helping us, \nfind the dark labyrinth and destroy the \nfoul beasts.\n \nMay the Great Eye watch over you.\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitAkara"	"46\nI should add that many Rogue scouts \nhave died in that horrible place. We \ncannot afford to lose any more. If you \nchoose to enter that Den of Evil, you \nmust do so alone.\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitKashya"	"87\nThe demons in that cave have claimed \nmany of my finest archers. I wonder \nhow you will fare!\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain"	"95\nThe beasts from the cave have begun to \nroam throughout the countryside. \nYou'd better be careful out there.\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt"	"95\nYou seem like a noble warrior. I hope \nyou can help us.\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitGheed"	"67\nYou're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust \nmy sacred scepter into the foulest, \ncarbuncular trull than set one boot \ninto that cave.\n"
"A1Q1AfterInitWarriv"	"122\nOne who seeks that cave, seeks death.\n"
"A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara"	"85\nYour task is not complete until you have \nkilled all the demons in that cave.\n"
"A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya"	"111\nYou'd better come through on this. Your \nreputation depends on it.\n"
"A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi"	"148\nYou haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do \nyou need anything?\n"
"A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed"	"73\nDemons still befouling that cave, huh? I \nthink you might need a new weapon.\n"
"A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv"	"124\nOne who hesitates... does so with good \nreason.\n"
"A1Q1SuccessfulAkara"	"65\nYou have cleansed the Den of Evil. \nYou've earned my trust and may yet \nrestore my faith in humanity.\n \nYour reward is training in the skill of \nyour choice.\n"
"A1Q1SuccessfulKashya"	"74\nHmm. I'm surprised you survived that \ntest, outlander. Go see Akara. She may \nreward you.\n"
"A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi"	"94\nYou are truly brave and skillful... Akara \nwas worried about you.\n"
"A1Q1SuccessfulGheed"	"87\nThe only good demon is a dead one, I \nsay.\n \nBy the way, did you happen to find \nanything in that cave you'd like to sell?\n"
"A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv"	"120\n...That which does not kill you makes \nyou stronger.\n"
"A1Q2InitKashya"	"56\nMy Rogue scouts have just reported an \nabomination in the Monastery \ngraveyard!\n \nApparently, Andariel is not content to \ntake only our living. Blood Raven, one \nof our finest captains in the battle \nagainst Diablo at Tristram, was also \none of the first to be corrupted by \nAndariel.\n \nNow, you'll find her in the Monastery \ngraveyard raising our dead as \nzombies!\n \nWe cannot abide this defilement! If you \nare truly our ally, you will help us \ndestroy her.\n"
"A1Q2AfterInitKashya"	"80\nDeath has done nothing to weaken \nBlood Raven's combat skills. If \nanything, she's more deadly than ever.\n"
"A1Q2AfterInitCharsi"	"99\nBlood Raven was the leader of a Rogue \nband that once fought Diablo at \nTristram.\n"
"A1Q2AfterInitGheed"	"94\nI'm sorry... The undead are bad for \ntrade. I have a strict no-return policy.\n"
"A1Q2AfterInitAkara"	"51\nBlood Raven fought valiantly against \nDiablo in the catacombs beneath \nTristram... She was never quite the \nsame afterwards. It is now obvious she \nbrought an evil influence back with her.\n"
"A1Q2AfterInitWarriv"	"140\nHmmm...\n \nHow can one kill what is already dead?\n"
"A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya"	"99\nEach moment you delay adds another \nundead Sister to Blood Raven's army.\n"
"A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara"	"70\nIf you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear \nthat our Order will perish forever.\n"
"A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi"	"68\nAkara felt something was wrong even \nbefore Andariel descended upon us. \nShe feared that Blood Raven had \nstumbled upon some evil force beneath \nTristram.\n \nI wish we had acted then...\n"
"A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed"	"77\nI wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is \namong the undead? Oh, she had dirt on \neverybody.\n"
"A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv"	"86\nWhen the dead return to prey upon the \nliving, it is a terror beyond \nunderstanding.\n"
"A1Q2SuccessfulKashya"	"55\nI can hardly believe that you've defeated \nBlood Raven!\n \nThough she was once my closest friend, \nI pray that her tortured spirit remains \nbanished forever.\n \nYou have earned my respect, stranger... \nand the allegiance of the Rogues. I \nhave placed several of my best \nwarriors at your disposal.\n"
"A1Q2SuccessfulAkara"	"122\nAndariel must be made to pay for her \nsacrilege!\n"
"A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi"	"77\nKashya wishes to reward you for your \ndefeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, \ntoo, even though Blood Raven was once \nmy friend.\n"
"A1Q2SuccessfulGheed"	"148\nSome of those gals weren't so nice the \nfirst time around.\n"
"A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv"	"104\nYou've done well, stranger. I hope all \nyour efforts are worth it.\n"
"A1Q4InitAkara"	"50\nIt is clear that we are facing an Evil \ndifficult to comprehend, let alone \ncombat.\n \nThere is only one Horadrim sage, \nschooled in the most arcane history \nand lore, who could advise us... His \nname is Deckard Cain.\n \nYou must go to Tristram and find him, \nmy friend. I pray that he still lives.\n"
"A1Q4AfterInitScrollKashya"	"90\nThe bark of Inifuss holds mystical \nrunes.\n \nAkara can translate them... into our \nrevenge!\n"
"A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara"	"42\nTristram is too far to journey by foot... \nCain would likely be dead, when you \narrived. However, there is a magical \nportal that will take you there \ninstantly.\n \nTo open it, one must stand within the \ncircle of Cairn Stones and touch them \nin a certain order. The proper order \ncan be found in the runes written on \nthe bark of the Tree of Inifuss.\n \nYou must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss \nand bring back its bark. I will translate \nthe runes to unlock the Stones' mystic \npattern.\n"
"A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi"	"117\nIf you bring back the bark of Inifuss, \nAkara will tell you how to get to \nTristram.\n"
"A1Q4AfterInitScrollWarriv"	"68\nMonths ago, I came across a few \nsurvivors from Tristram. They said \nthat Cain had gone half-mad and could \nno longer distinguish fact from \nfantasy.\n"
"A1Q4AfterInitScrollGheed"	"98\nI would sooner micturate in a tankard \nof my own ale than journey to \nTristram!\n"
"A1Q4InstructionsCharsi"	"150\nWithout the bark of Inifuss you can't \nfind Cain.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnSAkara"	"76\nHow will you find Cain without going to \nTristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is \nthe first step on your journey.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnSKashya"	"96\nThe Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but \nyou'll know it when you see it.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnSGheed"	"99\nBarking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll \nfind it, just keep looking.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnSWarriv"	"70\nHe who seeks that which cannot be \nfound must look inside himself for \nfurther guidance... or look harder!\n"
"A1Q4SuccessfulScrollKashya"	"82\nWith this scroll you may open a portal \nback to Tristram. Only Akara can \ndecipher its logic.\n"
"A1Q4SuccessfulScrollCharsi"	"168\nGet this to Akara.\n \nOnly she can understand it.\n"
"A1Q4SuccessfulScrollGheed"	"72\nLook, friend... I trade a lot of strange \nitems, but I'm not going to start \ndealing in bark. Okay?\n"
"A1Q4SuccessfulScrollWarriv"	"86\nThis looks like gibberish to me. Akara \nmay know what to make of it.\n"
"A1Q4InstructionsAkara"	"64\nAh, very good. I have translated the \nrunes on this scroll. You must find the \nCairn Stones and touch them in the \norder that I have written.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnKashya"	"103\nDeckard Cain has crucial knowledge \nabout the Evils we face. You must find \nhim!\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnCharsi"	"92\nI have heard that Tristram is now in \nruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin \nof all of us.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnGheed"	"68\nI'm told that Tristram now resembles a \nmead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! \nI will wait here for your most glorious \nreturn.\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnWarriv"	"82\nIt is too dangerous to travel to \nTristram. I won't be leaving here until \nthe way is clear!\n"
"A1Q4EarlyReturnAkara"	"64\nIf he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in \ngrave peril! You must hurry to Tristram \nbefore all is lost!\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulAkara"	"82\nYou have risked your life to rescue \nCain. For that we thank you.\n \nWe must seek his counsel immediately.\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulKashya"	"78\nAgain, you amaze me, outlander.\n \nThe Sisterhood is grateful to you for \ndelivering Cain to us. I believe Akara \nhas something to tell you.\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulGheed"	"53\nAh, Cain is here... another customer. I \nhaven't been this pleased since a \nlove-starved maiden let down a bit \nmore than her hair.\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCharsi"	"102\nAkara wishes to reward you for your \nbravery in returning Deckard Cain.\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulWarriv"	"80\nOnly a brave adventurer could return \nwith Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward \nfor your valor.\n"
"A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCain"	"74\nAs a token of my gratitude, I will \nidentify items for you at no charge.\n"
"A1Q4RescuedByHeroCain"	"82\n...I thank you, friend, for coming to my \naid.\n"
"A1Q4RescuedByRoguesCain"	"75\nOh... Blessings on the Rogues! They \nfinally rescued me from that cursed \nplace!\n"
"A1Q4TragedyOfTristramCain"	"33\nRegrettably, I could do nothing to \nprevent the disaster which devastated \nTristram. It would appear that our \ngreatest fears have come to pass. \nDiablo, the Lord of Terror, has once \nagain been set loose upon the world!\n \nAs you know, some time ago Diablo was \nslain beneath Tristram. And when our \nhero emerged triumphant from the \nlabyrinth beneath town, we held a \ngrand celebration that lasted several \ndays.\n \nYet, as the weeks passed, our hero \nbecame increasingly aloof. He kept his \ndistance from the rest of the townsfolk \nand seemed to lapse into a dark, \nbrooding depression. I thought that \nperhaps his ordeal had been so \ndisturbing that he simply could not put \nit out of his mind.\n \nThe hero seemed more tormented every \npassing day. I remember he awoke \nmany times -- screaming in the night -- \nalways something about 'the East'.\n \nOne day, he simply left. And shortly \nthereafter Tristram was attacked by \nlegions of foul demons. Many were \nslain, and the demons left me to die in \nthat cursed cage.\n \nI believe now that Tristram's hero was \nthat Dark Wanderer who passed this \nway before the Monastery fell.\n \nI fear even worse, my friend... I fear \nthat Diablo has taken possession of the \nhero who sought to slay him. If true, \nDiablo will become more powerful than \never before.\n \nYou must stop him or all will be lost.\n"
"A1Q5InitQuestTome"	"36\n...And so it came to pass that the \nCountess, who once bathed in the \nrejuvenating blood of a hundred \nvirgins, was buried alive... And her \ncastle in which so many cruel deeds \ntook place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising \nover the buried dungeons in that \ngod-forsaken wilderness, a solitary \ntower, like some monument to Evil, is \nall that remains.\n \nThe Countess' fortune was believed to \nbe divided among the clergy, although \nsome say that more remains unfound, \nstill buried alongside the rotting skulls \nthat bear mute witness to the \ninhumanity of the human creature.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitGheed"	"110\nThe only wealth you're likely to find \nthere is a wealth of vermin.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitCharsi"	"70\nThat old tower is as rotten on the inside \nas it appears on the outside. I heard \nthat several Sisters came to a \ngruesome end when a stairwell \ncollapsed on them.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitAkara"	"67\nThe dangers there are not solely \narchitectural. Once inside that \nwretched place, many succumb to a \nvile miasma.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitCain"	"60\nThat tower marks a place of danger. \nThere is an epic poem about it... How \nmuch sorrow one can stand was tested \nthere.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitWarriv"	"81\nRumors of treasure are no different \nfrom rumors of any other kind. They \nhold false promise to those who should \nknow better.\n"
"A1Q5AfterInitKashya"	"78\nThe tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we \nhave found are death, delirium, and \ndisappointment.\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnKashya"	"151\nHave you suddenly lost your taste for \nwealth?\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnCain"	"94\nQuickly in and quickly out is all the \nadvice I can give you.\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnWarriv"	"118\nBetter an empty pocket than a full \ngrave.\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnCharsi"	"170\nYou're not ready to give up, are you?\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnAkara"	"140\nThere is no more I can tell you about \nthat ancient tower.\n"
"A1Q5EarlyReturnGheed"	"79\nGuess what! I've named a boil on my \nass after you. It, too, bothers me every \ntime I sit down.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulKashya"	"79\nYour rewards are well-earned. To us, \nthe tower was nothing more than a \nheadstone looming over a long \nforgotten grave.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulWarriv"	"62\nRemember. Wealth is as insubstantial \nas a cloud and passes as quickly. \nIgnore Gheed. All that twitters is not \nbold.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulGheed"	"68\nWarriv's advice is like corpse gas; it \nbefouls the air for a moment and then \nit disappears.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulAkara"	"58\nI thought the stories of treasure in the \ntower were nothing but lies. I am glad \nyou found something of value in that \ndeath-trap. Would that our Sisters had \nbeen so fortunate.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulCharsi"	"126\nThose riches will serve you well on the \nlong road ahead.\n"
"A1Q5SuccessfulCain"	"69\nWell done, my friend. Courage and \nopportunity together have created in \nyou a kind of alchemy.\n"
"A1Q3InitCharsi"	"66\nWhen I fled the Monastery, I left behind \nthe Horadric Malus, my enchanted \nsmithing hammer. If you can retrieve it \nfor me, I'll use its magic to strengthen \nyour equipment.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitCain"	"51\nThe Malus was forged and enchanted by \nthe ancient Horadric Mages during the \nSin Wars. When their union dissolved, \nthe Malus was entrusted to the \nSisterhood guarding the pass into the \nEast.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitAkara"	"59\nThe retrieval of the Horadric Malus is \nnot without risk. Our Monastery is \nfilled with voracious hellspawn. You'd \nbest be careful, my friend.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitKashya"	"61\nCharsi is wasting her time and talents \nusing an inferior hammer! Had she the \nHoradric Malus, she could make the \nsteel sing and craft you a suit of armor \nas impenetrable as the Great Eye.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitCharsi"	"87\nThe Monastery can confuse even those \nwho know it well. Stay alert in there.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitGheed"	"74\nCharsi talks of nothing anymore, but \nthis Horadric Malus. Between you and \nher my ears need a rest.\n \nJust find it and bring it back quickly.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt"	"74\nI have offered my nomadic phallus, but \nto no avail.\n"
"A1Q3AfterInitWarriv"	"68\nJust as an archer needs bow and arrow, \nor a draughtsman pen and paper, so \nCharsi needs the Horadric Malus with \nwhich to ply her trade.\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnCain"	"57\nThe Malus has eluded you so far. Well, \nsearch thoroughly in the Barracks... \nThat is where the Rogues kept their \nforge.\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara"	"98\nIf you can't carry out this quest, how \nwill you face the greater evils ahead?\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya"	"71\nTo do battle with Andariel requires \nmore than thick skin and a strong will. \nYou'll want armor and weaponry forged \nwith the hammer's enchantments.\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi"	"89\nThe Malus is a Horadric artifact of \ngreat power. Please bring it back.\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed"	"90\nI have heard that you bear us no Malus.\n"
"A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv"	"120\nWhat better opportunity to show your \nmettle?\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulCain"	"59\nThe magical effects imbued by the \nMalus are impossible to predict, but \nare always to the good.\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulAkara"	"57\nWell done, my friend. But remember, the \nreturn of the Horadric Malus is but one \nstep in reclaiming the Monastery.\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulKashya"	"74\nNow that the Horadric Malus is back in \nour possession, we shall use it to \ndeliver a great blow against the Evil \nwhich torments this land.\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi"	"72\nOh! Thanks so much for returning the \nHoradric Malus! I will now imbue one of \nyour items with magical powers.\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulGheed"	"120\nI guess it's too late to take back some \nof the names I called you.\n"
"A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv"	"118\nI am glad the hammer has returned and \nyou with it.\n"
"A1Q6InitCain"	"34\nIt is certain that we face the demon \nqueen, Andariel, who has corrupted the \nRogue Sisterhood and defiled their \nancestral Monastery. This does not \nbode well for us, my friend.\n \nAncient Horadric texts record that \nAndariel and the other Lesser Evils \nonce overthrew the three Prime Evils -- \nDiablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing \nthem from Hell to our world. Here, they \ncaused mankind untold anguish and \nsuffering before they were finally \nbound within the Soulstones.\n \nAndariel's presence here could mean \nthat the forces of Hell are once again \naligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. \nIf this is true, then I fear for us all.\n \nYou must kill her before the Monastery \nbecomes a permanent outpost of Hell \nand the way east lost forever.\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitCain"	"45\nDiablo is heading east for some foul \npurpose. And the only passage east is \nthrough the Monastery gate. \nObviously, Diablo summoned Andariel \nto block any pursuit.\n \nFor her part Andariel hopes to win \nDiablo's favor... the lesser demons are \nalways vying for positions of power \nwithin the unholy hierarchy!\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitAkara"	"63\nAndariel has desecrated all we hold \ndear. She must not be permitted to \nserve Diablo.\n \nDestroy her! Her corruption of our \nOrder must be undone!\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitCharsi"	"132\nSend Andariel back to the Hell she came \nfrom!\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitGheed"	"71\nYou're going after Andariel?\n \n... One of my wagon wheels is in need of \nrepair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm \nneeded.\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitWarriv"	"72\nThe mapmakers tell us the shortest \ndistance between two points is a \nstraight line.\n \nOur way east is a line that runs through \nAndariel's stronghold, the Monastery.\n"
"A1Q6AfterInitKashya"	"81\nI can imagine a thousand different ways \nto kill Andariel. You need only choose \none.\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturnCain"	"48\nIt is clear that Andariel is acting on \nbehalf of Diablo to prevent anyone \nfrom following him eastward. Her \ndefeat would allow you to continue the \npursuit.\n \nAncient lore has it that while Andariel \nwas spawned in the Burning Hells, she \nis not fond of fire.\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturnAkara"	"57\nYou have done much to help us, but I \nsense that this has only fueled \nAndariel's fury. She will not stop until \nwe are all dead.\n \nYou must kill Andariel before her army \ncan gain the upper hand.\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturnGheed"	"72\nHave you stumbled upon that Demon \nQueen, yet? I hear she's quite the \nbeauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish \ngo, that is.\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturnCharsi"	"108\nIf you are the hero that you seem to be, \nnow is the time to prove it.\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturnWarriv"	"90\nMay I remind you that my caravan can \nonly go east, if the Monastery is \ncleansed?\n"
"A1Q6EarlyReturn2Kashya"	"126\nDeckard Cain has important information \nabout Andariel.\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulAkara"	"64\nFinally, we may rejoice!\n \nWe owe you a debt we can never repay. \nI only hope that in time we will be able \nto rebuild our Order.\n \nAll our thanks go with you, my friend.\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulCharsi"	"86\nYou'll probably go east now... It was \ngood to know you. I hope you'll come \nback if you ever need anything.\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulKashya"	"44\nAndariel's death brings about renewed \nlife for us all. We mourn the loss of our \ndear Sisters, but at least now we can \nget on with our lives.\n \nI... may have misjudged you, outlander. \nYou are a true hero and testament to \nthe noble spirit which has inspired our \nOrder for generations.\n \nFare well... my friend.\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulGheed"	"100\nI'm going to party like it's 999!\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulWarriv"	"82\nThe caravan is prepared. We may now \njourney eastward to Lut Gholein.\n"
"A1Q6SuccessfulCain"	"38\nThis is a great victory indeed, but many \nmore battles await. I will accompany \nyou on your journey, lending what \nassistance I can... \n \nRemember... Diablo is still out there, \nseeking something in the desert. I'm \nafraid that this nightmare will not end \nuntil you find what it is that he seeks.\n"
"PalaceGuardGossip1"	"600\nHalt.\n"
"PalaceGuardGossip2"	"255\nYou may enter the palace.\n"
"PalaceGuardGossip3"	"255\nWelcome to the palace.\n"
"PalaceGuardGossip4"	"255\nYou may enter the palace.\n"
"PalaceGuardGossip5"	"290\nStay out of trouble.\n"
"GriezIntroGossip1"	"58\nI'll bet you wonder how this town \nmanages to stay safe with all the \ntrouble going on out in the desert. \nWell, I can tell you that it's got nothing \nto do with the local town guards... \nthey're all in the palace for some \nreason.\n \nJerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to \nhelp keep the peace around here. We're \nnot cheap, but we're the best this \nwasteland has to offer.\n"
"GriezGossip1"	"85\nWe do a good job in town, but beyond \nthe city gates, you'll find all manner of \ndemons.\n"
"GriezGossip2"	"52\nThe local guards were all relocated to \nthe palace after the troubles began. No \none really knows why. Actually, all of \nthe town's brothel girls have been \nhiding out in the palace's cellar lately, \nso I assume that the guards have been \nassigned to 'protect them' with their \nlives.\n"
"GriezGossip3"	"75\nI might spare you a few of my men. \nWhy, enough gold can muster an army.\n"
"GriezGossip4"	"61\nJerhyn's got a nice little trading post \ngoing here. Despite his youth, he is a \nclever businessman. As you can see by \nthat palace, he's done quite well for \nhimself.\n"
"GriezGossip5"	"99\nWe're keeping the town safe and tight, \nbut I've got a hunch there's something \nJerhyn's not telling us.\n"
"GriezGossip6"	"44\nAh, Elzix is quite a character. I had a \nfew run-ins with his band of outlaws in \nmy younger years. Now, he's as settled \nas the dunes out there. The Desert Rain \nInn is his pride and joy these days.\n"
"GriezGossip7"	"53\nAtma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm \nsure the loss of her family has made \nher lonely. Perhaps I should go over \nand console her when I get off duty \ntonight...\n"
"GriezGossip8"	"72\nGeglash is an imposing warrior, but he's \nnever been able to back down from a \nfight. One of these days, his pride will \nbe the death of him.\n"
"GriezGossip9"	"67\nMeshif has sailed all around the \nsouthern seas and visited many \nstrange lands. It must be driving him \nmad, having to stay anchored here.\n"
"GriezGossip10"	"70\nI haven't talked much to Fara. She \nkeeps to herself most of the time. I get \nthe feeling that she doesn't like us \nmercenary types much.\n"
"GriezGossip11"	"73\nI'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. \nHe's always mixing his damned potions \nand chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised \nif he winds up blowing himself to \nsmithereens!\n"
"GriezGossip12"	"85\nDrognan's a mystery to me. Then again, \nI never did trust mages much.\n"
"ElzixIntroGossip1"	"61\nHmm... You look like a sturdy \nadventurer.\n \nYou know, I used to be quite the \nscoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest \ngroup of bandits who ever terrorized \nthese sands!\n \nNowadays, I run this here Inn and \npretty much stay out of trouble.\n \nMy days of adventuring are behind me.\n"
"ElzixIntroNecGossip1"	"48\nAh... You must be one of the new \nheroes who've come to rid our city of \nevil. Under any other circumstances, I'd \nbe surprised to see one of your kind in \nthe city. But lately... Oh, never mind all \nthat...\n \nYou know, I used to be quite the \nscoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest \ngroup of bandits who ever terrorized \nthese sands!\n \nNowadays, I run this here Inn and \npretty much stay out of trouble.\n \nMy days of adventuring are behind me.\n"
"ElzixGossip1"	"52\nYou know, I've lost a number of body \nparts over the years. An eye here, a leg \nthere...\n \nSay, do you know any spells that'd grow \nthem back for me? Hmm... On second \nthought, I'll leave well enough alone.\n"
"ElzixGossip2"	"90\nWhat tales Drognan can tell... You \nwould do well to listen carefully to that \nwizened wizard.\n"
"ElzixGossip3"	"80\nThere are many ancient tombs in the \ndesert. Most of them are already \nplundered, but I imagine that some \nhave remained hidden.\n"
"ElzixGossip4"	"67\nI miss the brothels that used to do \nbusiness here.\n \nYou know, all of the ladies fled to the \npalace as soon as the trouble in the \ndesert started. You'd think that they \ncould at least come out once in a while \nnow that Greiz and his men have things \nrelatively under control.\n"
"ElzixGossip5"	"71\nAtma... Now, there's a fine woman. \nLately, though, she's only thinking \nabout revenge. She has reason \nenough...\n"
"ElzixGossip6"	"71\nWe've all fared well under Jerhyn's \nleadership. The town has remained \nsafe throughout this whole mess; and \nyet the lad still seems very upset about \nsomething.\n"
"ElzixGossip7"	"88\nGeglash is a fool who would fight his \nown shadow if he could. Fighting's all \nhe ever thinks about!\n"
"ElzixGossip8"	"74\nMeshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise \nenough to know silver from tin and \ntruth from dung, that's for sure.\n"
"ElzixGossip9"	"65\nFara is a good woman. She seems very \nsad, but seldom speaks of her past. \nShe's good to the poor and helps \npeople when she can. That makes her \nall right in my book.\n"
"ElzixGossip10"	"30\nIt took me 10 minutes of detective work\nto find this string after I accidentally\ndeleted it. For this reason, I refuse to\nrestore it. So there."
"WarrivAct2IntroGossip1"	"62\nNow that Andariel is dead, I can return \nand outfit the Rogues properly. Once \nI've made some trades here, I'll be free \nto head back to their Monastery. Let \nme know if you want to travel along.\n"
"WarrivAct2Gossip1"	"106\nCaravans take people where they want \nto go - until they get there.\n"
"WarrivAct2Gossip2"	"80\nBy ship is the only way eastward from \nhere. I believe Captain Meshif has a \nsmall trading vessel moored at the \ndocks.\n"
"WarrivAct2Gossip3"	"70\nThere used to be a lot of brothels \nhere... I guess the troubles scared all \nthe women away, or maybe they're \n'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.\n"
"WarrivAct2Gossip4"	"53\nThat old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty \nas they come. Years back, he made off \nwith a small fortune of my caravan's \nwares. I certainly never expected to see \nhim so... domesticated.\n"
"WarrivAct2Gossip5"	"57\nJerhyn has his father's strength and \nwits. He's young, but he rules this \nplace with wisdom and care. I think \nhe'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided \nwe all survive this crisis.\n"
"AtmaIntroGossip1"	"59\nYou'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've \nsuffered a loss recently, but that's not \nyour problem.\n \nIt's a relief to see some proper warriors \ncome through here. My name is Atma. I \nrun the tavern here in Lut Gholein.\n"
"AtmaGossip1"	"86\nEvil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and \nyou may be our last hope...\n"
"AtmaGossip2"	"56\nThis public house used to be quite lively, \nuntil this plague of evil. Luckily, I've \nmanaged to save away a tidy nest egg. \nUnfortunately, I couldn't save \neverything I cared for...\n"
"AtmaGossip3"	"57\nIn addition to my public house, there \nused to be several brothels doing \nbusiness here. When the troubles first \nstarted in the desert, the harem guilds \nsought sanctuary within the palace.\n \nOf course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll \nbet they're finding many ways to repay \nhim for his protection.\n"
"AtmaGossip4"	"70\nGeglash may seem like a sot, but he's a \nbrave man. All this trouble has driven \nhim to drinking more than his usual.\n"
"AtmaGossip5"	"64\nElzix and I have reached an \nunderstanding over the years. He \nsends travelers to me for drink and \nentertainment, and I send them back to \nhim for a soft bed. The travelers often \ntrade their wares for lodging.\n"
"AtmaGossip6"	"89\nMeshif seldom patronizes my \nestablishment. I think he prefers to \nstay out there on his leaky ship.\n"
"AtmaGossip7"	"71\nOh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good \nold man. He used to give me medicines \nwhen... my son was ill.\n"
"AtmaGossip8"	"78\nDrognan is a very private person. He's \nalways studying ancient scrolls and \nsuch. He may be a mystery to me \nforever.\n"
"GeglashIntroGossip1"	"57\nBah! I don't know why you people keep \npestering me.\n \nGreiz seems to have this place locked \ndown nice and tight. Not that I couldn't \nhave done the same! I've proven my \nvalor in combat plenty of times.\n"
"GeglashIntroBarGossip1"	"43\nHey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya? \nFerocious as the wild beasts of the \nnorth, that's what they say. I suppose \nyou've come to help save this city. You \nneedn't bother.\n \nGreiz seems to have this place locked \ndown nice and tight. Not that I couldn't \nhave done the same! I've proven my \nvalor in combat plenty of times.\n"
"GeglashGossip1"	"46\nHey, I heard that you Barbarians can \nwield multiple weapons at once. I never \nlearned to fight two-handed. Carrying a \nsword and a wineskin at the same time \nis all I can ever handle.\n"
"GeglashGossip2"	"53\nSure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did \nyou hear about the harem guilds? They \nwere the only ones allowed to hide out \nin the palace when the raids started!\n \nAh... It figures.\n"
"GeglashGossip3"	"64\nI've killed plenty of those demons out in \nthe desert. It doesn't seem to slow \nthem down any, though... they just \nkeep coming back for more.\n"
"GeglashGossip4"	"55\nHave you found those big sand maggots \nyet? Arrows and all that don't work so \nwell against them. Best thing is to hack \n'em with a sword or such.\n"
"GeglashGossip5"	"58\nThere are some ancient tombs out there \nin the desert. You have to go pretty far \nto find them, though. Rumor has it that \nthey're crawling with walking corpses \nnow.\n \nAs if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers \nweren't bad enough.\n"
"GeglashGossip6"	"67\nYeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be \ndamned if I ever get on his ship. I don't \neven like to drink water.\n"
"GeglashGossip7"	"52\nJerhyn's been acting strange lately. I \ncan't imagine why he recalled the town \nguards into the palace. If there is \nsomething wrong in there, I hope he \ndoesn't expect me to handle it.\n"
"GeglashGossip8"	"57\nI've seen Fara defend herself against a \nfew drunken ruffians. She's got moves \nI've never even seen before. Wherever \nshe's from, she sure learned how to \nfight there.\n"
"GeglashGossip9"	"83\nI've got no time for old alchemists. \nLysander would be completely useless \nin a real fight.\n"
"MeshifIntroGossip1"	"63\nGreetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this \nship here. I make port runs around the \nTwin Seas and occasionally out to \nKingsport in Westmarch.\n \nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, \nthough... Jerhyn has ordered me to \nstay docked here in case of emergency.\n"
"MeshifIntroAmaGossip1"	"54\nGreetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one \nof your kind in many years.... It's good \nto know that warriors of your caliber \nare protecting this city.\n \nI'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I \nmake port runs around the Twin Seas \nand occasionally out to Kingsport in \nWestmarch.\n \nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, \nthough... Jerhyn has ordered me to \nstay docked here in case of emergency.\n"
"MeshifGossip1"	"62\nI was wondering if you've heard any \nnews from Kurast? I know you \nAmazons travel extensively. Have you \nbeen there recently?\n \nHmm... Well, I hope the port opens \nsoon. I need to get home to Kurast and \nfind out what's been happening there.\n"
"MeshifGossip2"	"72\nThere's something Jerhyn's not telling \nme, I just don't know what. To my eye, \nthings here in town don't look that bad, \nespecially since Warriv's caravan route \nopened up.\n"
"MeshifGossip3"	"65\nI've been all around the seas in these \nparts. It's dangerous sailing west this \ntime of year, though. Until the season \nchanges, the caravan through the \ndesert is the main trade route to \nWestmarch.\n"
"MeshifGossip4"	"75\nMy ship is the only way East from here. \nStill, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may \nnot leave until the current crisis is \nover.\n"
"MeshifGossip5"	"65\nOh, I've known Elzix for years. He \nalways offers me a free room at his Inn \nwhen I dock here, but I prefer the \ncomforts of my own cabin.\n"
"MeshifGossip6"	"61\nWarriv is a good friend. We've shared \nmany tales, he and I. If we had it all to \ndo over again, I believe we'd both be \nexplorers of some renown.\n"
"MeshifGossip7"	"69\nGreiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I \nhope he can handle it if those things in \nthe desert decide to attack this town.\n"
"MeshifGossip8"	"130\nAtma serves a fine ale in her \nestablishment.\n"
"MeshifGossip9"	"70\nHah! That braggart Geglash says he \nfears neither man nor beast. Yet, when \nI offer to take him out to sea, he \nquakes with fear.\n"
"MeshifGossip10"	"130\nThe lady Fara has a proud, noble air \nabout her.\n"
"JerhynActIntroGossip1"	"41\nGreetings, honored traveler. I am \nJerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid \nyou welcome to my fair port-city. I'm \nglad to know that once again caravans \nare free to travel through the Western \nPass.\n \nFor some time now, we have been under \nsiege by an evil power that I cannot \nidentify. Strange... It all began when a \nDark Wanderer came this way, looking \nfor the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one \nknows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper \nof Baal, is entombed, but it is certain \nto be far out in the desert.\n \nNow, my people whisper tales of the \ndead rising from their tombs and \nhorrible creatures lurking amongst the \nmoonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed \nthings which I cannot explain. I've \nordered the port closed and all trade \nships moored until I am sure that my \ncity is safe.\n \nAtma, the tavernkeeper, has an \nimportant mission for you. Go see her \nimmediately. You'll find her on the \nother side of town.\n \nNow, I must return to the palace. I \napologize, but I can't invite you in. \nThings are... rather a mess right now.\n"
"JerhynActIntroMoreGossip1"	"51\nFor trade in magic and the like, see \nDrognan or Lysander. Drognan is the \nwisest man I know - without equal in \nmagic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander \nis nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion \nchemist.\n \nFor travel back west, see Warriv, whom \nyou already know.\n \nOur own Fara is a fine and honest \narmorer, and she can heal wounds as \nwell.\n \nElzix is the Innkeeper and may also \nhave some items to trade.\n \nGreiz, the mercenary captain I hired to \nsecure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps \norder in town, as well.\n \nThere are others here, too. I'm sure \nyou'll meet most of them. Just look \naround...\n"
"JerhynIntroGossip1"	"117\nThings are getting worse by the hour. I \nknow everything looks fine, but trust \nme, it isn't!\n"
"JerhynGossip1"	"117\nThings are getting worse by the hour. I \nknow everything looks fine, but trust \nme, it isn't!\n"
"JerhynGossip2"	"63\nTo any who aid me in the defense of Lut \nGholein, I pledge my support. Passage \nEast, wealth, honor - all are due to \nthose who help my city.\n"
"JerhynGossip3"	"71\nYou seem very capable, but no offense \nis intended when I say that I must \nchoose my confidants carefully. It \nwouldn't do to have rumors sending \neveryone into a panic.\n"
"JerhynGossip4"	"87\nEven though he was once a bandit, I \npermitted Elzix to take over the Desert \nRain Inn. He has been quite civilized \never since.\n"
"JerhynGossip5"	"76\nWhen you arrived, Warriv's caravan had \nbeen long overdue. With all of the evil \nthat's arisen in the land, I'm surprised \nhe got through at all.\n"
"JerhynGossip6"	"77\nMeshif is an honorable man, but I fear \nthat he is growing impatient with me \nabout impounding his ship. I dare not \ntell him what's really happening in this \ncity.\n"
"JerhynGossip7"	"98\nThe woman, Atma, may have some \nuseful gossip for you. She can always \nbe found near her public house.\n"
"FaraIntroGossip1"	"81\nI know much about the ancient \nreligions. I was trained as a Paladin of \nZakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple \nmany years ago.\n"
"FaraIntroPalGossip1"	"103\nWelcome, brother Paladin.\n \nI am Fara. I was once a devout \nchampion of Zakarum.\n"
"FaraGossip1"	"67\nPerhaps, in time, you will play a part in \nreclaiming our Order's honor and \nspirit. You are an inspiration to me, \nbrother Paladin.\n"
"FaraGossip2"	"60\nThe shrines in the desert are leftover \nartifacts from the great Sin War that \nravaged these lands almost a thousand \nyears ago. They still function, but most \ntravelers believe them only to be \nremnants of the distant past.\n"
"FaraGossip3"	"54\nI've no love for brothels, as they can \nlead honorable men to do dishonorable \nthings. Since the local harems took up \nhiding in the palace, however, there \nseems to be a rise in foul tempers.\n"
"FaraGossip4"	"66\nWhen the Three Evils were bound ages \nago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was \nmoved to Kurast and bound by the \nholiest of magics.\n"
"FaraGossip5"	"79\nWarriv may not remember me, but I \nhelped him out when I was a young \nPaladin. There's no need for me to \nremind him. The rewards for honor will \nnot come in this life.\n"
"FaraGossip6"	"68\nGreiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in \nhis heart, he will always be a \nmercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to \nthose who have no loyalty to \nthemselves.\n"
"FaraGossip7"	"90\nAtma is a good, loving woman. But I \nfear she will succumb to her despair \nand hatred.\n"
"FaraGossip8"	"95\nGeglash is too confident in his abilities. \nA warrior's true strength is in his \nheart.\n"
"FaraGossip9"	"94\nMeshif is an honest man as far as I can \ntell. He has never pestered me about \nmy past.\n"
"LysanderIntroGossip1"	"61\nHow do I know I can trust you? Hmm?\n \nYou may be as shifty as that pack rat, \nElzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you \nneed a potion, though, I suppose I can \nmake you one... for a price, of course.\n"
"LysanderGossip1"	"109\nPotions are delicate mixtures. They're \njust as liable to go off in your face as \nanything.\n"
"LysanderGossip2"	"65\nAh... The sweetest desert flower - that's \nAtma. Even my strongest brew can't \nbring back her family, though.\n"
"LysanderGossip3"	"86\nThere are some ancient enchanted \nfountains in the desert that can heal \nyour wounds - if you drink enough from \nthem.\n"
"LysanderGossip4"	"71\nOh. Deafness has its advantages, you \nknow. I'm no longer forced to overhear \nthe tedious gossip of others.\n"
"LysanderGossip5"	"54\nI never patronized the brothels, mind \nyou. But since those ladies took up \nhiding in the palace, there certainly has \nbeen less scenery to feast my eyes on.\n"
"LysanderGossip6"	"95\nOh... I have great faith in Greiz. He \nseems to have things well in hand.\n"
"LysanderGossip7"	"90\nI've traded my potions to Warriv many \ntimes. Yes. They seem to fetch a good \nprice in the western lands.\n"
"LysanderGossip8"	"71\nI've sold many sea-sickness potions to \nMeshif over the years. It seems that \nmany of his passengers don't take well \nto the rocking of his ship on the open \nseas.\n"
"LysanderGossip9"	"58\nOh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase \nminor love potions from me, hoping to \nwin the favors of the harem girls.\n \nBut now that the girls have taken up \nresidence in the palace, he doesn't \ncome around here anymore. Well, \nwell... I've always said, 'alchemy is no \nsubstitute for experience'.\n"
"LysanderGossip10"	"57\nDrognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of \nmine. I help him find exotic spell \ncomponents and alchemical books from \ntime to time. I think he used to be a \nsorcerer of great renown, but he \ndoesn't like to talk about his past.\n"
"DrognanIntroGossip1"	"61\nI've heard that you are responsible for \nbanishing Andariel back to the Burning \nHells. I'm impressed, stranger. That \ncouldn't have been easy.\n \nMy name is Drognan and I know what \nyou're up against, my friend.\n \nYou ought to look over my inventory of \nitems for trade.\n"
"DrognanIntroSorGossip1"	"50\nWelcome, young Sorceress, to Lut \nGholein. I hope your skills are a match \nfor the horrors that lie beyond the \ncity's walls. A mage of your limited \nexperience may find the evil too great \nto withstand alone.\n \nMy name is Drognan and I know what \nyou're up against, my friend.\n \nYou ought to look over my inventory of \nitems for trade.\n"
"DrognanGossip1"	"74\nMany of the Mage Clans feel that \nwomen shouldn't practice magic \nopenly. But since you've made it this \nfar, I must say that you have proven \nyour right to do so.\n"
"DrognanGossip2"	"57\nThe Horadrim were a powerful Order, \nalthough maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha \nwas one of their Order. And that \nshould tell you something.\n \nAny man who believes himself strong \nenough to contain one of the Prime \nEvils is in for a rude awakening, I \nshould think.\n"
"DrognanGossip3"	"78\nI have heard of your friend, Cain. He is \nthe last of the Horadrim. You would do \nwell to heed whatever advice he has to \ngive you.\n"
"DrognanGossip4"	"53\nNot long ago, one of my Vizjerei \ncomrades, who I believed had died in \nTristram, came to this city. He seemed \nquite insane, so I dismissed much of \nwhat he said.\n \nHowever, he was able to talk his way \ninto Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen \nhim since. I fear that fool may have \nfound something in the palace that led \nto his doom.\n"
"DrognanGossip5"	"68\nI've been practicing magic for more \nyears than you could know. I'm older \nthan I look, though not so old that I \ncan't conjure up a few sparks.\n"
"DrognanGossip6"	"67\nElzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of \ncourse, he never tries to cheat me. He \nknows what my magic skills can do.\n"
"DrognanGossip7"	"86\nDemons have spread throughout the \ndesert wasteland and threaten to \nengulf our quiet port-city.\n"
"DrognanGossip8"	"88\nMeshif and his vessel should remain \nhere, lest we risk taking demonic \nstowaways to other lands.\n"
"DrognanGossip9"	"58\nWhen the recent troubles began, Lord \nJerhyn came seeking my council. I \nadvised him to close the port and put \nthe town under strict watch.\n \nLately, though, he's been occupied \nwithin the palace. I doubt his whores \ncould divert him from his civic duties \nfor this long, though.\n"
"DrognanGossip10"	"68\nLysander is harmless enough. We keep \neach other company with our mutual \ninterests, yet I don't think he could \nhandle the enormity of our present \nsituation.\n"
"CainAct2Gossip1"	"48\nGreetings, my friend. Have you spoken \nto Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable \nleader for being such a young man. \nThen again, the old blood has always \nrun strong in this land.\n"
"CainAct2Gossip2"	"71\nThere is something about Fara that \ntroubles me. Her manner is strange for \na lonely desert-maid.\n"
"CainAct2Gossip3"	"70\nElzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him \nall the same.\n"
"CainAct2Gossip4"	"59\nI talked at length with Warriv as we \ncrossed the desert from Khanduras. He \nhas many fascinating tales of the \ndangers in the desert. His experience \nmay be useful to you.\n"
"CainAct2Gossip5"	"57\nMeshif is an interesting man. Part of \nhim longs for the freedom of the open \nseas... Yet his heart belongs in his \nhomeland.\n"
"TyraelGossip1"	"42\nI thank you, mortal, for my freedom. \nBut I did expect you earlier.\n \nI am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here \nto prevent Diablo from freeing his \nbrother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, \nTerror and Destruction roam free \nthroughout your world.\n \nEven now, they head towards the \nEastern capital of Kurast - to the very \nheart of the Zakarum Temple. There \nthey hope to find their eldest brother, \nMephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was \nimprisoned there ages ago.\n \nIf the three Prime Evils unite, they will \nbe invincible. Though it is unclear as to \nwhat their aims are, it is certain that \nthey must be stopped at all costs.\n \nI am broken and the energies that tie \nme to this world are diminishing \nrapidly.\n \nYou must take up this quest and \nprevent the Three Brothers from \nreuniting. You must cross the sea and \nsearch for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.\n \nNow hurry, mortal... Time is running \nout for all of us!\n"
"Desert2GuardGossip1"	"50\nHey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if \nyou leave town now.\n"
"A2Q1InitAtma"	"50\nI don't expect this of you, but if you \nwant to help me, I would be grateful.\n \nIn the sewers below our city, there lurks \na horrid creature that hungers for \nhuman flesh. The creature has killed \nmany, including my son and my \nhusband.\n \nIf you destroy it, I will reward you. \nPlease be careful though, that beast \nhas taken enough from us already.\n \nThe sewer entrance is through the trap \ndoor just up the street.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitGreiz"	"52\nI've personally found some of that \ndevil's victims washed up out of the \nsewer. Often, they are missing limbs or \na head, and their bodies have always \nbeen skinned.\n \nAt first the creature raided the town at \nnight... That's how Atma lost her \nfamily. Now we've got him barricaded \nin the sewers.\n \nYou're safe up here on the surface, but \nevery now and again some fool wants \nto be a hero and heads down to the \nwaste tunnels with a pig-sticker.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitElzix"	"68\nI hear that the creature kills his victims \nin order to hack off their limbs! I guess \nthat makes me a less likely candidate, \neh?\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitWarrivAct2"	"84\nI've heard tales of walking corpses out \nin the desert at night, though I've never \nactually seen one.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitGeglash"	"77\nHey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a \nhole into your skull with my thumb.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitFara"	"54\nI believe that the creature you refer to \nis one of the ancient Horadric \nmummies from the tombs that lie \nburied beneath the desert sands. It is \nunusual for one of his kind to be so far \naway from his resting place. I sense in \nthis entity a restless and malevolent \nspirit.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitAtma"	"62\nThe creature makes its lair in the \ntunnels beneath this city. He butchered \nmy husband and son... I simply cannot \nbear to talk about it...\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitMeshif"	"63\nThere are two entrances to the sewers, \nI believe. One of them is right near \nhere, down by the water beneath the \ndocks. I can see it from my ship, and \nyou can bet I keep an eye on it every \nnight.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitDrognan"	"53\nFara and I have been talking about the \ncreature recently. From my studies, I \nhave deduced that it is Radament the \nFallen, an ancient Horadric mummy \nthat has for some reason left his tomb \nto prey on mortals.\n \nI'm doing some more research now. If \nyou check back later, I may have some \nmore insight as to his nature.\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitLysander"	"94\nI hear that beast is after body parts. \nDoes he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!\n"
"A2Q1AfterInitCain"	"48\nThe Horadrim used to mummify their \nhighest mages, and infuse them with \nspells that would allow them to protect \ntheir tombs, even after death.\n \nI have no idea why one of them would \nbe acting so malevolently. Perhaps \nDrognan or Fara would know more \nabout this.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnWarrivAct2"	"90\nDeath is not afraid of the living, but the \nliving abhor death.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnMeshif"	"55\nI noticed a rotting, human arm floating \nin the harbor this morning. I suspected \nfoul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't \nseem too concerned since there haven't \nbeen any folk reported missing lately.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnAtma"	"83\nI am starting to have second thoughts \nabout my request... I couldn't bear the \nthought of you losing your life on my \nbehalf.\n \nPlease be careful.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnGreiz"	"69\nWe've been meaning to send an \norganized group down there to kill that \nthing, but it would be dangerous. We \njust can't afford the chance of losing \nany men with all the trouble that's \ngoing on in the desert.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnGeglash"	"65\nAh-hah! Back for a small shot of \ncourage... Believe me, it doesn't help \nfor long.\n \nDrinks, barkeep!\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnElzix"	"69\nIf you're going to fight that thing, use \nsome common sense. Be knowledgeable \nabout what harms the undead. Poison, \nfor instance, will have little effect.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnLysander"	"64\nHuh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, \nyes. Ooh, a foul creature...\n \nSome of my exploding potions should do \nquite nicely against him. They usually \nwork well against the undead.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnDrognan"	"49\nI've just been reading something \ninteresting about this sort of undead. \nApparently, certain Horadric funereal \npriests altered the bodies of their dead \nmages with magical and surgical \ntechniques -- often replacing body \nparts with those of animals.\n \nThis was thought to augment their \npowers, and raise their status in the \nafterlife.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnFara"	"68\nDrognan told me something interesting \nearlier today. It might explain why \nRadament is so restless, and it might \nhave something to do with why he is \nstealing human body parts.\n"
"A2Q1EarlyReturnCain"	"41\nThe Horadric mummies were created to \nprotect the tombs, but Radament is far \nfrom his burial chamber. Given the \naberrations that have been witnessed \nlately, it comes as no surprise that \neven the ancient guardian spells have \nbegun to unravel. Be wary of this as \nyou venture farther into the desert.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulGreiz"	"76\nYou've killed Radament, eh? That's quite \na nice piece of work! If you ever need a \njob as a mercenary, I'd be happy to \nsign ya' up.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulDrognan"	"52\nFrom what you tell me, it would seem \nthat Radament was bent on the task of \nreviving his own mummified corpse \nwith the flesh of the living.\n \nThis is very unusual indeed. It takes an \nincredible magic power to alter the \nsingular purpose of an undead mind.\n \nPerhaps there is a power at work here \nwhich is beyond my ken.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulLysander"	"61\nUh... Little of what I am able to hear is \nof any value. Radament's death, \nhowever, is news worth hearing. I'm \nsure Atma will be glad to hear of this.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulMeshif"	"62\nGood job mate! At night out on my ship, \nI was often awakened by that fiend's \nawful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulGeglash"	"41\nWhoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?\n \nI've fallen off many a barstool and no \none calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They \nmight go so far as to say, 'Geglash, \nyou've fallen!'\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulElzix"	"70\nWe ran into one of those old tomb \nguardians when I ran with my bandits. \nI know they aren't easy foes to face, so \nyou sure have my respect. Have you \ntold Atma yet?\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulWarrivAct2"	"142\nAtma's been telling everyone what \nyou've done for her.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulFara"	"102\nAs you have helped Atma and all of us, \nso shall I help you.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulCain"	"57\nIf you haven't already, tell Atma that \nRadament is dead. It may help to ease \nthe weight of her mourning.\n"
"A2Q1SuccessfulAtma"	"50\nThey say that the taste of vengeance is \nbittersweet, but I find it to my liking. \n \nIn addition to my undying gratitude, I \nhave spoken on your behalf with the \nrest of the townspeople. The \nmerchants have agreed to show their \ngratitude by offering their wares and \nservices at lower rates.\n \nOh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. \nYou'll find him in front of the palace.\n"
"A2Q2EarlyReturnScrollCain"	"37\nAhh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a \nfortunate turn of events...\n \nAs the last living Horadrim, I alone have \nknowledge of its meaning. Now, to read \nthe Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...\n \nThe Horadric Mages, after binding Baal \nwithin Tal Rasha, magically sealed off \nhis Burial Chamber from the mortal \nrealm. Those same Mages also crafted \nfearsome Horadric Staves and imbued \nthem with the special power to open \nthe Chamber's hidden door.\n \nAfter nearly losing one to the thievery \nof a rogue sorcerer, they divided all \nthe Horadric Staves into two parts - \nwooden shaft and metal headpiece - \nhiding them separately to safeguard \nthem.\n \nThe Horadrim foresaw our current \nplight and designed the hiding places \nto reveal themselves to worthy heroes \nlike you.\n \nCollect both parts of a Horadric Staff \nand unite them using a Horadric Cube. \nThen, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n"
"A2Q2EarlyReturnCapCain"	"50\nThe Viper Amulet you bear is actually \nthe headpiece of a Horadric Staff!\n \nYes... You have an uncanny knack for \nfinding rare and valuable artifacts. Of \ncourse, you'll have to use a Horadric \nCube to combine the headpiece with the \nshaft.\n"
"A2Q2EarlyReturnStaveCain"	"56\nThe Staff of Kings! You astound me, my \nfriend. You have discovered the shaft \nportion of a Horadric Staff.\n \nI trust you know how to use a Horadric \nCube to unite the shaft with its \nheadpiece.\n"
"A2Q2EarlyReturnCubeCain"	"40\nYou have quite a treasure there in that \nHoradric Cube. According to Horadric \nlore, the Cube can restore a Horadric \nStaff.\n \nTo do it - use the Cube as you would a \nscroll. When the Cube opens, place \nboth pieces of the Staff into it and use \nthe Cube's transmute power.\n \nYou'll be pleased to know that the Cube \nhas other alchemical uses as well...\n \nSix gems plus one sword transmute into \na socketed long sword.\n \nYou may also transmute two quivers of \ncrossbow bolts into one quiver of \narrows, while two quivers of arrows \nyield one quiver of bolts.\n \nI must leave it to you to discover other \nformulae.\n"
"A2Q2SuccessfulStaffCain"	"46\nExcellent! You have a Horadric Staff.\n \nCarry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. \nFind within the Tomb the chamber \nwhose floor is inset with the Circle of \nSeven Symbols.\n \nPlace the Staff into the receptacle you \nfind there. That will open the secret \npassage into Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n \nBut, be prepared for a fight - you'll \nlikely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy \nBaal.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitJerhyn"	"110\nMy astrologers failed to predict this \neclipse. You should seek Drognan's \nadvice.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitGreiz"	"71\nThis midday darkness reeks of foul \nmagic! My men and I are trying to keep \nthe peace, but this kind of thing really \nscares people.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitElzix"	"65\nTwo men arrived late last night bearing \na story about evil magic. They said \nthey saw a gathering of giant snake \ncreatures performing some arcane \nritual. They sound like the Serpent Men \nof the desert.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitWarrivAct2"	"72\nThe sun has grown disgusted with the \nterrible deeds it must shine upon each \nday. Damnation is upon us all.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitAtma"	"121\nDrognan, the wizard, will have some \nidea as to what is happening.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitGeglash"	"100\nThis whole place is one big ale fog.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitFara"	"70\nThis unnatural nightfall is no doubt \ncaused by evil sorcery. Drognan might \nknow what we are dealing with.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitLysander"	"65\nClaw Vipers! This outer darkness \nmirrors the inner blackness of their \nsouls. It is they who have eclipsed the \nsun, I'll wager. They are a venomous \nband.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitDrognan"	"77\nI've been researching this lengthy \neclipse and I believe it to be the work \nof Claw Vipers.\n \nFind their temple beneath the desert \nsands and you may find the source of \nthis curse.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitMeshif"	"76\nThis permanent darkness is very \nunsettling. Hmmm... It would make \nnavigation by stars easier for me, \nthough.\n"
"A2Q3AfterInitCain"	"62\nDrognan may have some advice on this \nmatter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with \nhim myself.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnJerhyn"	"130\nThis eclipse is a definite manifestation \nof evil.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnGreiz"	"73\nDon't worry! My men and I have an iron \ngrip on this town. If those cursed Claw \nVipers are plotting anything against \nus, we'll be prepared for 'em.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnWarrivAct2"	"73\nThe calculated coldness of the reptilian \nbrain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny \nadversaries.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnGeglash"	"49\nIt's strange when the morning after the \nnight before... is still the same night.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnMeshif"	"105\nI've had about enough of this darkness. \nI don't even know what day it is \nanymore.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnFara"	"77\nThe Claw Vipers practice evil magic. \nThey have also been known to kidnap \ntravelers and sacrifice them to their \ndark gods.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnLysander"	"82\nWell... I don't know much about the \nhabits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. \nDrognan will probably know something \nabout the nature of the magic at work.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnDrognan"	"51\nI've discovered a reference to a similar \neclipse several hundred years ago. It \nsays that some desert-dwelling snake \ndemons had erected an evil altar, \nwhich caused the sun to go black.\n \nPerhaps we are dealing with something \nsimilar here. Look for an altar in the \nClaw Viper temple.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnElzix"	"94\nI usually charge for rooms by the night.\n \nBut I may have to soon change that.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnCain"	"57\nThe source of this spell is probably a \nmagical altar. It will not be enough to \nkill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the \nspell you must destroy the altar.\n"
"A2Q3EarlyReturnAtma"	"80\nI was going to go to bed, but then I \nrealized that I have no idea what time \nit is. It could be the crack of dawn, for \nall I know.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulJerhyn"	"96\nThe sun again shines on Lut Gholein! I'm \nbeginning to like you, traveler.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulGreiz"	"219\nI'm glad that's over with!\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulElzix"	"74\nAhh... It takes but one eye to revel in \nthe beauty of our restored sun.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulGeglash"	"60\nSo, this is daylight... It's over-rated.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulWarrivAct2"	"80\nWith renewed daylight, one may gather \nthe wits that were scattered about like \nrestrictive undergarments in the \ndarkness.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulMeshif"	"130\nSo... Did you plunder any booty?\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulAtma"	"132\nYou have done well to restore light to \nour world.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulFara"	"87\nDrognan seems to have taken you into \nhis confidence. This is good, for you \nwill benefit from his wisdom.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulLysander"	"69\nAhhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical \nartifacts. Did you happen to find one in \ntheir temple?\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulDrognan"	"69\nYou did well in destroying the Claw \nVipers. We are all glad to see the sun \nreturned to its former glory.\n"
"A2Q3SuccessfulCain"	"48\nI've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and \nI sense that he is becoming more and \nmore agitated by something. You \nshould try to talk to him again.\n \nIf he still won't take you into his \nconfidence, seek to prove yourself a bit \nmore. I gather that his respect for you \nis growing.\n"
"A2Q4InitDrognan"	"41\nI've been researching the old records, \ntrying to find the location of Tal \nRasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found \nthe Tomb, itself, I may have a good \nlead for you.\n \nThe great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, \nbuilt his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere \naround here. He was a powerful \nspellcaster and kept demons as slaves \nwithin the Sanctuary. He kept a close \neye on great events, too -- such as the \nimprisonment of Baal within Tal \nRasha's Tomb.\n \nIf you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, \nI'm sure that it would hold some clue \nas to the Tomb's location. Though I \ndoubt Horazon is still alive, you must \nproceed with caution. There's no telling \nwhat could be waiting inside.\n \nWhen I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, \nhe asked that I send you to him. \nPerhaps he knows of a secret entrance \nor the like.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitFara"	"46\nAh, the ancient mage Horazon! He \nbelieved that he could bend Evil forces \nto his will. What he didn't know was \nthat Evil uses man, not the reverse.\n \nThe Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol \nof man's ability to triumph over other \nworldly forces. The Church of Light, \nhowever, cites him as an example of \nman's folly.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitGreiz"	"89\nThe only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the \nharem girls that have been hiding there \nsince the troubles began.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitElzix"	"62\nAn 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the \npalace? I'd heard that there were some \nunderground cellar levels that Jerhyn \nused as chambers for his treasure and \nsuch, but no Arcane Sanctuary.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitJerhyn"	"44\nWhen the troubles began here, I allowed \nthe terrified Harem guilds to join me \nwithin the safety of the palace. All was \nfine, until one night...\n \nScreams echoed up the stairwells from \nthe harem. My guards arrived to find \nthe poor girls being slaughtered by a \nmerciless band of hell-spawned \ndemons. My brave guardsmen tried to \npush the demons back into the \nmysterious rift from which they came.\n \nEver since, my men have fought a losing \nbattle. Demons have continued to pour \nthrough the rift into the palace. \nUltimately, I hired Greiz and his \nmercenaries to help protect the rest of \nmy fair city.\n \nDrognan believes that the Arcane \nSanctuary lies buried underneath this \npalace, since Lut Gholein occupies the \nsite of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.\n \nMy palace is open to you now... Take \ncare.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitCain"	"45\nI very much doubt that Horazon still \nlives in his Sanctuary. He possessed \ngreat power and influence over \ndemons, but even that may not have \nbeen enough in the end. One of his \nnotoriety cannot easily remove himself \nfrom the vengeful reach of Hell.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitGeglash"	"60\nLook, look... I'm just about as tough and \narrogant as they come, but you'd never \ncatch me trying to tame a demon for a \npet. That's just asking for a lot of \ntrouble.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitAtma"	"75\nArcane Sanctuary? That place sounds \nawful! Even if you find a way into it, \nwhat makes you think you'll be able to \nleave again?\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitWarrivAct2"	"73\nA careful caravan gives wide berth to \nsleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, \nlet him remain so.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitLysander"	"49\nHorazon found it necessary to lock \nhimself up for all time, just to protect \nhimself from those angry demons. \nSuch is the fate of one who practices \nthe summoning arts... that, or eternal \ndamnation. There's old summoners and \nbold summoners, but no old, bold \nsummoners.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitDrognan"	"42\nNearly a thousand years ago, Horazon \nrose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage \nclan. Horazon used the knowledge of \nthe Vizjerei to summon and control \ndemons from Hell.\n \nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon \nfeared that the Lords of Hell would \npunish him for enslaving their \nbrethren. Thus, the Summoner created \nfor himself an Arcane Sanctuary.\n \nHe believed that his Sanctuary would \nnot only protect him from Hell's \nvengeance, but also allow him to \ncontinue his studies free from the \nravages of time and disease.\n \nHorazon had crafted many wondrous \nscrying devices through which he \nobserved the events of the world \noutside. It is certain that he took \ncareful study of Tal Rasha's \nimprisonment and recorded the \nlocation of his forgotten Tomb.\n \nThe Arcane Sanctuary was believed to \nhave been constructed here in Lut \nGholein. An entrance may be hidden \nsomewhere in the palace, as that \nbuilding is very old, and was once a \nVizjerei fortress.\n"
"A2Q4AfterInitMeshif"	"57\nAhh... The legend of Horazon is an old \none, especially around these parts. You \nwouldn't believe the feats and strange \nevents that are attributed to him.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnElzix"	"63\nI understand that you've been talking to \nJerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first \nin a long while... since the trouble \nbegan, actually.\n \nDo us a favor and try to find out what's \ngot Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnJerhyn"	"48\nThere was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, \nI believe... who visited me almost a \nyear ago. He was very interested in the \nhistory of this site, and he seemed \nparticularly fascinated with the palace \narchitecture.\n \nI gave him a tour. When he found the \nancient seals over a passageway in the \ncellar, he became very agitated. He \nasked for some time alone to study \nthem, and I granted it.\n \nShortly after, he left with no further \nword and I never saw him again. Odd... \nDon't you think?\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnGreiz"	"61\nWhat's got you so occupied in the \npalace? Don't tell me you're finding the \nHarems more compelling than killing \ndemons? That would be out of \ncharacter for one such as yourself.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnDrognan"	"63\nI am certain that you will find the \ninformation you need when you find \nHorazon's Journal. I suggest you find it \nquickly, for Diablo may be getting \ncloser to freeing his brother as we \nspeak.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnLysander"	"68\nHuh? The horizon is always out of \nreach, you should know that. Oh, \nHorazon! Oh, I see. Uh.\n \nYes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, \nbut... total lunatic.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnFara"	"57\nEven a sanctuary such as Horazon's \ncan be breached by the tentacles of \nEvil. Such a haven could have become a \nchamber of unspeakable horrors. Be \nwary of what you may unleash!\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnGeglash"	"49\nAll my years of brawling, of pummeling \nboth the unsuspecting and the \ndeserving, have yielded two insights. \nYou can either fight or you can run. All \nother strategies are variations of \nthese.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnMeshif"	"77\nSo... Now that you're such a pal of \nJerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can \nset sail one of these days? I'm running \nout of patience.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnAtma"	"87\nSo you've been in the palace, have you? \nTell me, why does Jerhyn keep that \nplace locked up so tight?\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnWarrivAct2"	"87\nFate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt \nyou with dung if you mock it.\n"
"A2Q4EarlyReturnCain"	"51\nI've been thinking about the problems in \nJerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has \noccurred to you as well...\n \nIf those cellar passageways lead to the \nArcane Sanctuary, then that is where \nthe demons came from. Horazon's \nhaven must have been breached!\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulNarrator"	"37\nSeekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will \nfind it through the Portal. But know \nthat the glowing glyphs recorded here \nin my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs \nof the six False Tombs.\n \nThe missing Seventh Sign marks the \nTomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim \nhe might be called the foremost.\n \nIt was a shining - but brief - moment for \nthe Mage Clans when they set aside \ntheir differences and worked together \nagainst the common enemy.\n \nThe Horadrim relentlessly pursued the \nThree across the desolate Empires of \nthe East, and even into the uncharted \nlands of the West, leaving the \nArchangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.\n \nPresuming the Three to be vanquished, \nthe Horadrim's unstable fellowship \nbegan to dissipate. Abandoning their \nsacred charge to safeguard the three \nSoulstones, the disparate Mage Clans \nbegan to squabble amongst each other \nover petty differences.\n \nTheir conflicts not only dissolved their \nbrotherhood, but strengthened the \nEvils which they had buried beneath the \ncold earth.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulGriez"	"59\nUnbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! \nThe palace guards have been fighting \noff demons from the cellar. How could \nthat happen without my knowledge?\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulJerhyn"	"62\nI thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also \nglad that you found something you \nwere looking for. The journal should \nhelp you find the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha. Hopefully, there is still time to \nget there before Diablo.\n \nGo now. And good luck.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulDrognan"	"55\nYou have found Horazon's Journal. \nExcellent... But, I must caution you.\n \nThe mark of the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha, is sought, if not already known, \nby Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the \nimplications of that.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulElzix"	"71\nNews of the tragedy in the palace is \nspreading fast. How awful! And to \nthink, this whole time I thought Jerhyn \nand his guards were in there playing \nwith the harem girls.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulGeglash"	"60\nHah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the \npalace. I would've saved those girls and \nkicked demon ass back to the fire-pits \no' Hell!\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulMeshif"	"52\nSo... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. \nWell... I guess I can see why he wanted \nme to stay, though... I'm just glad it \ndidn't come to that. Now he tells me to \nwait some more, in case you need to \nget out of here.\n \nWell, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll \nmention me in the epic ballads, eh?\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulWarrivAct2"	"67\nWell, the news going around town is \nvery unsettling. Apparently, we were in \nmore danger than anyone thought.\n \nGood work friend... you may have saved \nall our skins.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulFara"	"64\nFaith is stronger than any armor. The \nshield will protect the body, but Faith \nwill strengthen the courageous heart.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulLysander"	"55\nHorazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, \nwell... Glad you found it. Such a shame \nabout those poor harem girls, huh? I \nshall miss them deeply... I mean their \nconversations, of course.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulAtma"	"62\nOh, those poor women! Will the \nslaughter never end? Thank you once \nagain for protecting our city.\n"
"A2Q4SuccessfulCain"	"57\nYou must move quickly now, friend, for \nDiablo is undoubtedly close to finding \nwhat he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal \nRasha before he frees the Lord of \nDestruction.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnGreiz"	"89\nThat guy really talks like that? Sounds \nlike either Horazon has gone stir-crazy \nor that's some impostor.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnJerhyn"	"57\nThe man you describe is probably not \nHorazon.\n \nHe sounds like the very mage who came \naround here a while ago. He was very \ncurious about this palace and seemed \nespecially interested in the seal on the \npassageway in the cellar. He left \nshortly after that. I wonder how he got \ndown there? The seal was never \nbroken...\n \nThat mage spoke a great deal to \nDrognan. Why don't you ask him about \nit?\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnDrognan"	"47\nYes... The man you speak of sounds like \nthe mage who came here many months \nago. He claimed to have fought Diablo \nin the passages beneath Tristram.\n \nNo doubt the fool wandered into \nHorazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever \nwas left of his ravaged mind. He is \nbeyond salvation. \n \nIt is possible that the fool has been \npossessed by the spirit of Horazon. If \nthat's true, then you'd better put an \nend to his tortured existence.\n \nOnce done, I believe the demons who \nwere summoned and imprisoned within \nthe Sanctuary will cease to exist as \nwell.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnLysander"	"57\nAh, yes. I remember. There was a... \nfellow around here many months ago \nwho asked almost as many questions \nabout Horazon as you.\n \nSo... He discovered enough to assume \nHorazon's place in the Arcane \nSanctuary, huh? What a fool!\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnMeshif"	"72\nAh, yes. As a ship captain I am well \naware of the phenomenon of a false \nHorazon.\n \nSorry, just a little joke.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnWarrivAct2"	"99\nThere's nothing more dreadful than a \npowerful being driven by a frayed \nmind.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnAtma"	"105\nYou always seem to find the worst \ntrouble. I don't know how you handle it.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnGeglash"	"38\nSo! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be \nsurprised if he wasn't. All those \ncenturies without ale would drive \nanyone to drink... but then you couldn't \ndrink. And that would drive you to \ndrink... Hah?... What was the question?\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnFara"	"63\nHmmm... That doesn't sound like \nHorazon. I'll agree that he may have \ngone mad, but from what you tell me, I \ndon't think that's the case. Talk to \nDrognan... he may know more than I.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnElzix"	"106\nUgh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.\n \nJust kill him and get on with your \nbusiness.\n"
"A2Q5EarlyReturnCain"	"45\nThe appearance of the mage you \ndescribe sounds like one I met back in \nTristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight \nagainst Diablo, the Lord of Terror. \nPerhaps, this is one of them.\n \nYou know, fate seems to have frowned \nupon all of the heroes who confronted \nthat terrible Evil. Take care or the \nsame may happen to you.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulGreiz"	"76\nSo, Horazon's been dead for some time. \nI take it you at least found what you \nwere looking for.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulGeglash"	"60\nThe way I see it... Well, it's all pretty \nblurry.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulJerhyn"	"63\nThe demonic force that was emanating \nfrom the corrupted Sanctuary has \ndissipated. I thank you greatly for your \nhelp. Now, we can look to rebuilding \nour lives.\n \nAll will be for nothing, though, if you do \nnot stop the greater Evil which is \nrapidly gaining ground.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulDrognan"	"83\nLarger forces are moving inexorably \ntowards us. You must now make haste \nto the Tombs.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulElzix"	"65\nYou make me long for the days of glory. \nWhen I had both hands, both eyes and \nmore of a foot...\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulWarrivAct2"	"84\nI guess you'll be heading to the Tombs \nnow? I hear that they're in the deepest \ndesert regions.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulMeshif"	"100\nWell! You've got what you're after. Now \nget a move on before it's too late.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulLysander"	"103\nHuhhh... Such is always the fate of \nthose who meddle with evil.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulAtma"	"89\nYou're more the hero than I could have \ndreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us \nafter all.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulFara"	"74\nI feel no pity for that would-be \nSummoner. His terrible ambition for \ndemonic power was his undoing. You \nmerely hastened the inevitable.\n"
"A2Q5SuccessfulCain"	"48\nI hope that this false Summoner found \npeace in death. Unfortunately, it is \nmore likely that he will be dragged \ndown into Hell by the demons he was \nbound to.\n \nLet this be a lesson to you... Demonic \nmagic is a quick path, but its powers \nare seductive and deadly.\n"
"A2Q6InitJerhyn"	"45\nI have heard of your many deeds of skill \nand bravery. I feel I can trust you with \nsomething I have been hesitant to \nspeak of...\n \nDrognan and I have concluded that the \nDark Wanderer who passed through \nhere recently was Diablo, himself! \nDrognan believes that Diablo is \nsearching the desert for the secret \ntomb where the great Horadric mage, \nTal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.\n \nYou must find Diablo and put an end to \nthe terrible evil that has fallen upon \nour city. Drognan is wise and is sure to \nhave some helpful advice for you as to \nhow Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.\n \nIt may take you quite some time to find \nThe Tomb. May you be ready when you \ndo.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitJerhyn"	"53\nIt is well-known that there are seven \ngreat Horadric tombs hidden beneath \nthe sands in the furthest reaches of \nthe desert. One of them surely must be \nTal Rasha's prison. You must explore \neach of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's \nexact location.\n \nOf course, Diablo is searching for the \nTomb as well... No one can guess as to \nwhat terrors he has unleashed in his \nsearch.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitElzix"	"59\nSo... You're going to search for the \nSeven Tombs, huh? Don't you know \nthat they're just desert legends passed \nbetween merchants and travelers? No \none really believes that they exist.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitWarrivAct2"	"61\nBe very careful, my friend. I think I've \nseen enough recently not to doubt that \nthese Tombs exist. And if they do, \nthey're most certainly guarded by \nterrible creatures.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitAtma"	"67\nI've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal \nRasha, but I thought they were just old \ntales meant to scare young children.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitGeglash"	"59\nOhh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... \nBut... umm... I don't like all that living \ndead stuff.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitMeshif"	"84\nI'm sorry, I can't help you much here. \nNow, if the tombs were across the \nocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitFara"	"57\nLegend has it that Tal Rasha lies \nimprisoned within his tomb, forever \nstruggling to keep the Lord of \nDestruction bound. His was a selfless \nact, although perhaps foolhardy.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitLysander"	"56\nWhen Tal Rasha chose to embody the \nspirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to \nwrestle eternally against the will of the \ngreater Evil. Look around you and ask \nyourself, 'Has the battle been won or \nlost?'\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitDrognan"	"55\nTal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the \ndesert among six others. Tal Rasha's \nsymbol marks the True Tomb. If you \nwant to know what that symbol is, you \nshould be able to find it within the \nlegendary Arcane Sanctuary.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitCain"	"57\nDiablo nears his goal. We have little \ntime to lose.\n \nRemember, my friend, that Andariel \ngave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. \nIt would be prudent to assume that the \nother Evils will attempt to aid their \nmaster as well.\n"
"A2Q6AfterInitGreiz"	"106\nIf you're going into the deep desert, why \nnot hire a few of my men to watch your \nback?\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulJerhyn"	"47\nYou have done very well. Few could have \ncome this far, let alone discover the \nTrue Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, \nI hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded \nyour grasp. This is most unfortunate...\n \nIf you wish to travel East, I have \nauthorized Meshif to give you passage \nby sea. I imagine he should be very \nanxious to leave by now.\n \nGood luck on your quest, and thank you \nagain for saving my beloved city. You \nwill always be welcome in Lut Gholein, \nmy friend.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulElzix"	"71\nI heard that Diablo has managed to \nbest you, at least for the time being. I \nhope you catch up with him soon, and \nsend him back to Hell for good!\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulLysander"	"70\nI'm sorry things didn't turn out as you \nhad hoped. Go and remember us \nfondly. You know, you bothered me far \nless than most.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulAtma"	"64\nYou have proven to be the greatest of \nheroes, and I am honored to call you \nfriend. Thank you for bringing peace to \nour lives again.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulWarrivAct2"	"68\nNever fear, my friend. You did the best \nyou could.\n \nI suspect that Diablo and Baal are now \nheading east, towards Kurast. You'll \nfind them... I know you will.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulFara"	"46\nThis is terrible news! Baal is in \npossession of one of mankind's most \npowerful mages, and the Lord of Terror \nguides his path. They must be stopped, \nfor I am sure they mean to free their \nelder brother Mephisto, the Lord of \nHatred, who lies imprisoned under the \ncorrupted city of Kurast.\n \nI fear you are walking into a great evil, \nbut your faith can save you. May you \nwalk in the light always.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulGeglash"	"54\nYou're an inspiration! And such a hero \nthat it makes me look twice as bad...\n \nAhh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some \nglory for us little guys, huh?\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulDrognan"	"51\nThis is a serious setback... It is most \nunfortunate that Tal Rasha has been \nconsumed by Baal's destructive \ninfluence. There are many secrets \nknown to the Horadrim, which could be \nused by Baal against us.\n \nYou must travel east by sea to Kurast \nand stop Diablo and Baal before they \nfree their eldest brother, Mephisto.\n \nHahh... The lands of the eastern Empire \nare not the same as they used to be. \nThere has been little word for some \ntime.\n \nSpeed is of the essence. Go quickly, my \nfriend. May the fates smile on you.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulMeshif"	"82\nJerhyn tells me I should take you east to \nKurast. I haven't been there for several \nyears, but rumor has it that things are \npretty grim.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulGreiz"	"51\nI've heard that your foe got away from \nyou this time. Well, look at it this way... \nyou've got the demons on the run. If \nyou're going to be leaving, then... Well, \nthanks for your help.\n"
"A2Q6SuccessfulCain"	"39\nThe Archangel Tyrael was the one who \ngave the Soulstones to the Horadrim \ntwo hundred and sixty years ago.\n \nIt is highly unusual for the forces of \nHeaven to so directly interfere with \nman's destiny, but Tyrael was said to \nact of his own volition. We have never \nbeen able to discern why.\n \nPerhaps, he goes against the consensus \nof Heaven because he doubts our \nability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, \nhe sees more threat than his peers.\n \nWhere the actions of Hell often seem \nstraightforwardly bent on destruction, \nthe motives of Heaven are \nunfathomable.\n \nNow make haste... Both Diablo and Baal \nmust be stopped before they join with \ntheir brother, Mephisto. If the three \nPrime Evils unite once again, the world \nas we know it will be no more.\n"
"NatalyaIntroGossip1"	"48\nGreetings, hero. I've heard of your \nexploits and... I'm quite impressed. \nVery few mortals are capable of \ndealing with the Three and their \nminions as you have.\n \nMy name is Natalya. I am a hunter of \nEvil, part of an ancient Order sworn to \nhunt down corrupted sorcerers.\n \nIf I could, I would gladly join your quest \nto stop the Three. But I must wait here \nfor further news. I can't predict what \nwill happen, but the danger is greater \nthan we can know.\n \nUntil I receive my orders, I'll assist you \nwith the information I have.\n"
"NatalyaGossip1"	"74\nAsheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking \nmage, but I'd wager she's never faced \ntrue Evil.\n \nPampering drunken mercenaries is one \nthing, but standing face to face with a \nhell-spawned demon is another.\n"
"NatalyaGossip2"	"69\nI've heard the name of Deckard Cain \nmany times. He's the last of the \nHoradrim, and thus, I must honor him. \nYou must be powerful, indeed, if one \nsuch as he accompanies you.\n"

"NatalyaGossip4"	"67\nMy Order has been keeping watch over \nOrmus for many years, now. He seems \nto champion the cause of good, but \nwho knows what shadow lurks within \nhis soul?\n"
"CainAct3IntroGossip1"	"45\nI've not set foot in glorious Kurast for \nmany years. But I never would have \nimagined it could be so corrupted.\n \nCertainly, this must be Mephisto's work! \nYou'd best get going, my friend. Diablo \nand Baal are still out there and you \nmust find them.\n"
"CainAct3Gossip1"	"62\nSeeing his homeland in such a state \nmust be horrifying to Meshif. I'm \nsurprised he's willing to remain here in \norder to help you.\n"
"CainAct3Gossip2"	"82\nAsheara seems like a very tough \nwoman. I'd be careful around her if I \nwere you.\n"
"CainAct3Gossip3"	"53\nDrognan told me of Hratli when we were \nin Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves \nmagic into his forge and produces \nmystical weapons and armor.\n \nHis skills could be quite useful to you. \n"
"CainAct3Gossip4"	"44\nJudging from his dress and strange \nmarkings, I would guess that Ormus is \nfrom the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet \nnone of the others here seem to know \nthat he is a sorcerer.\n \nThe Taan were once as powerful as the \nVizjerei clan, but their studies were \neven more secretive. I wonder what \nhe's hiding.\n"
"CainAct3Gossip5"	"49\nHave you met, Natalya? She appears to \nbe a member of the Khral-Harzhek, a \nsecret order that has been around for \ncenturies... almost as long as the \nHoradrim, itself.\n \nHer presence here makes me uneasy, \nfor they are traditionally sworn to hunt \ndown Magi who have betrayed the trust \nof their order.\n \nI wonder why she is here.\n"
"CainAct3Gossip6"	"73\nOrmus would like you to think him mad. \nBetter to watch his actions than listen \nto his words.\n"
"HratliActIntroGossip1"	"33\nWelcome to Kurast, traveler. Few come \nwillingly to this ancient city anymore.

"HratliGossip1"	"48\nYou're very brave to have come here. In \nthe old days, mages who didn't belong \nto one of the great Mage Clans were \nhunted down as renegades. But now, \nthe Mage Clans have little authority.\n"
"HratliGossip2"	"53\nWithin the Temple City stands a tower \nbuilt long ago by the Horadrim to \nimprison the... Well, you'll discover \nmore about it soon enough.\n"
"HratliGossip3"	"60\nIf you are another follower of Zakarum, \nI've told you people before I don't want \nyour Towering Spire or anything else \nyou have to sell!\n"
"HratliGossip4"	"74\nSome find my prices unreasonable. That \nis because I am unreasonable.\n"
"HratliGossip5"	"76\nYou'll find that the Zakarumites have \nthe persistence of zombies, but without \nthe charisma.\n"
"HratliGossip6"	"60\nAsheara leads the mercenary company \nknown as the Iron Wolves. You can hire \nsome of them, but many are occupied \nsecuring the dockside.\n"
"HratliGossip7"	"74\nAlkor is a potion dealer given over to a \nlife steeped in ceaseless study and \ndissipation.\n"
"HratliGossip8"	"58\nOrmus is a man of many mysteries. I \nsense strong magic about him, but he's \nnever spoken of it to me.\n"
"HratliGossip9"	"49\nI trust you already know Meshif. But did \nyou know that he was born and raised \nhere?\n \nI suspect that like many of us his spirit \nis near broken at the sight of Kurast's \ndecline. Only our brand of gallows \nhumor saves us from utter despair.\n"
"HratliGossip10"	"55\nThis, Cain, whom you brought with you. \nHe has the bearing of great power, yet \nI sense no magic about him. He is an \nenigma to me.\n"
"HratliGossip11"	"49\nNatalya is a quiet one. She arrived here \nabout a week ago and has pretty much \nkept to herself. She's inquired about \nmy weapons a few times, so I assume \nthat she's a warrior of some sort.\n"
"MeshifAct3IntroGossip1"	"51\nWell, I gave you my word, and brought \nyou here as promised.\n \nBut by all that's still holy, I wish I'd \nnever returned to this accursed place. \nThis fetid jungle can't be the fair \nKurast I left behind.\n \nI don't know what all this evil is, my \nfriend, but it's obvious that you must \nstop it.

"MeshifAct3Gossip1"	"63\nIt takes great courage and generosity \nto defend a land and a people that are \nnot your own. Perhaps, when this curse \nis lifted, my people can do something \nfor yours in return.\n"
"MeshifAct3Gossip2"	"72\nI shouldn't have boasted so much about \nKurast on the journey here. Oh... Much \nhas changed since I left.\n"
"MeshifAct3Gossip3"	"99\nThe dockside is apparently the only \ncivilized area left in Kurast.\n"

"MeshifAct3Gossip5"	"75\nYour companion, Cain, must have \nknown that he would be in grave \ndanger here. You are great, indeed, to \nelicit such loyalty.\n"

"MeshifAct3Gossip7"	"80\nI went to speak with old Alkor, but I \ndisturbed his studies. He doesn't seem \nto like visitors.\n"
"MeshifAct3Gossip8"	"73\nTrying to get information out of Ormus \nis like straining water from a rock. His \ndamned riddles are almost as \nconfusing as our current state of \naffairs.\n"

"AshearaIntroGossip1"	"54\nHello, there. You must be a great \nadventurer to risk coming here.\n \nMy name's Asheara, and I lead the \nmercenary band of mages known as \nthe Iron Wolves.

If you piss them off, \nthey can be worse than those monsters \nout in the jungle.\n"
"AshearaIntroAmaGossip1"	"50\nHello, there.

"AshearaGossip1"	"66\nYour skills are unique indeed. They are \nneither sorcery, nor physical, but seem \nto be a harmonious blend of the two. \nThe Iron Wolves could learn much from \nyour kind.\n"
"AshearaGossip2"	"160\nWhy fight fair, when you can hire some \nof us?\n"
"AshearaGossip3"	"107\nNo one comes to Kurast anymore \nwithout good reason. You must be \nseeking fame and fortune.\n"
"AshearaGossip4"	"137\nThe Iron Wolves and I have made a \ngood living around here lately.\n"
"AshearaGossip5"	"110\nThe jungle can take you down fast. Try \nto avoid getting trapped out there if \nyou can.\n"
"AshearaGossip6"	"90\nHratli may be a bit too clever for his \nown good. Still, I'd trust his work \nanytime.\n"
"AshearaGossip7"	"77\nHratli thinks he's so funny. The other \nday he said, 'Asheara, I don't recognize \nyou without that big gash on your \nface.'\n"
"AshearaGossip8"	"97\nMeshif says he used to live here. I'm \nsurprised he came back. I'll bet he \nwishes he hadn't.\n"
"AshearaGossip9"	"78\nI invited Natalya to join the Iron Wolves \nand she began lecturing me about the \n'dangers of magic'. Who the hell does \nshe think she is, anyway?\n"
"AlkorIntroGossip1"	"61\nDamn it, I wish you people would just \nleave me alone! I...\n \nOh, you're new here, aren't you?\n \nI am Alkor, the Alchemist.

I...\n \nOh, you're a Necromancer, aren't you? \nI've heard that your kind use powerful \npotions and such to wake the dead and \ncontrol spirits. I'd love to discuss what \ncomponents you use some time.\n \nI am Alkor, the Alchemist. I dabble in \npotions and salves, myself, and I can \nsell you some if you really need them.\n \n...Feel free to drop by anytime.\n"
"AlkorGossip1"	"55\nEven I can tell that the evil in the jungle \nis growing. I hope you survive out \nthere, my pasty friend. I'd still like to \ndiscuss what components are best \nused in necromantic potions.\n"
"AlkorGossip2"	"151\nCare to take a gander at my Grimoire?\n"
"AlkorGossip3"	"90\nI've never claimed that you'd live forever \nafter trying one of my potions! Merely \nthat you might look as though you had.\n"
"AlkorGossip4"	"105\nI keep a library of tomes - heretical, \nexegetical, hermeneutical and \npharmaceutical.\n"
"AlkorGossip5"	"50\nThere was a very fat man here recently \nasking after the Golden Bird of Ku \nY'Leh. Have you heard of it? He kept \nmuttering about ashes. I would imagine \none Golden Bird's ash-hole to be about \nthe same as another, wouldn't you?\n"
"AlkorGossip6"	"150\nI hope you don't object to my badgering \nthe witless.\n"
"AlkorGossip7"	"115\nYou came here with Meshif? That old \n'tour-guide to the stupid'!\n \nI'm surprised you made it here in one \npiece.\n"
"AlkorGossip8"	"98\nOh, Asheara's a good customer. She \nbuys a potion of manliness from me \nevery week.\n"
"AlkorGossip9"	"82\nHratli's only good for making his silly \nmagic weapons. It's not like he's got \nthe stones to actually go out and use \nthem on anything.\n"
"AlkorGossip10"	"88\nOh, Ormus has been talking in riddles \nfor years. I think he does it to cover up \nthe fact that he's got nothing \nintelligent to say.\n"
"AlkorGossip11"	"52\nYes, Natalya is a cute girl. However, I \nthink she could use a special potion.\n \nLet me see here, 'Radiant Beauty'... No. \n'Ray of Sunshine'... No, that's not it.\n \nAh, here it is: 'Relax Frosty Bitch'. This \nshould help her out.\n"
"OrmusIntroGossip1"	"38\nYou now speak to Ormus.\n \nHe was once a great mage, but now \nlives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You \nhave questions for Ormus and doubt in \nyourself. Ormus sees a strange \ndichotomy in you... as he does in all \nwould-be heroes.\n \nSpeak to him and he may grant you \nwisdom in turn. Or turn from him and \nseek wisdom in thyself.\n"
"OrmusIntroPalGossip1"	"37\nYou now speak to Ormus, good Paladin.\n \nHe was once a great mage, but now \nlives like a rat in a sinking vessel. You \nhave questions for Ormus and doubt in \nyourself. Ormus sees a strange \ndichotomy in you... as he does in all \nwould-be heroes.\n \nSpeak to him and he may grant you \nwisdom in turn. Or turn from him and \nseek wisdom in thyself.\n"
"OrmusGossip1"	"68\nThe Church which you serve is \ncorrupted by evil. Yet the holy \ndisciplines it taught you may yet save \nus all.\n \nThis is a strange time for heroes, \nOrmus thinks.\n"
"OrmusGossip2"	"65\nYour salvation can only be reached \nthrough Hatred. A strange fate, but a \ntrue one.\n"
"OrmusGossip3"	"52\nHow does one destroy Destruction? How \ndoes one force Terror to flee in fear? \nYou have great tasks ahead of you, \nOrmus thinks.\n"
"OrmusGossip4"	"72\nThe Church of Light harbors the darkest \nshadow of all. Tread lightly.\n"
"OrmusGossip5"	"89\nWhen speaking of the dead, it is best to \nremain cryptic.\n"
"OrmusGossip6"	"84\nThe Travincal can be breached by the \nloss of one's wits, not by the use of \nthem.\n"
"OrmusGossip7"	"95\nAlkor is able to explain things much \nmore clearly than Ormus.\n"
"OrmusGossip8"	"58\nFor one who spends so much time away \nfrom home, Meshif has taken Kurast's \ncorruption the hardest.\n"
"OrmusGossip9"	"91\nAsheara is both proud and \nself-conscious of her womanhood.\n"
"OrmusGossip10"	"65\nDeckard Cain... Ormus has no time for \nthe last son of the Horadrim. Pride led \nthat holy Order to failure.\n"
"OrmusGossip11"	"63\nHratli suspects that Ormus is a mage. \nHe can suspect whatever he wants, \nOrmus will not show him the true \nmagic.\n"
"A3Q4Init1CainAct3"	"53\nBack in Lut Gholein Meshif told me he \nhad a fondness for jade figurines. On \nhis trading voyages he collected an odd \nassortment of such small statues.\n \nI would show him your figurine. \n"
"A3Q4Init1Asheara"	"160\nOnly Deckard Cain can make sense of \nthis.\n"
"A3Q4Init2MeshifAct3"	"73\nPraise you! That jade figurine will \ncomplete the set I was collecting.\n \nHere! I've had this statuette of a golden \nbird for years, but I consider it a fair \nexchange.\n"
"A3Q4Init2Natalya"	"89\nI'm having fun just watching you run \nfrom place to place searching for a \nGolden Bird. Some hero you are.\n"
"A3Q4Init3CainAct3"	"47\nI've read legends about a sage named \nKu Y'leh, who studied the mysteries of \nlife beyond death.\n \nIf I remember correctly, his ashes were \nensconced within a golden statuette. It \nwas a very strange tale.\n"
"A3Q4Init3Hratli"	"134\nYou will have to take Ku Y'leh's ashes to \nAlkor.\n"
"A3Q4Init3Asheara"	"96\nSuch a beautiful statuette... But, you'd \nthink it would've been better cared for. \nThere's a compartment here that's full \no' dust.\n"
"A3Q4AfterInitAlkor"	"73\nAh, the Golden Bird of Ku Y'leh. Thank \nyou, my friend. \n \nBusy yourself while I experiment with \nthe ashes within it. Then, return and \nsee what I have made for you.\n"
"A3Q4AfterInitOrmus"	"51\nKu Y'leh, in searching for immortal \nyouth, found only an early death. His \napprentices, seeking to live forever, \nburned his body in order to derive \nbenefit from his ashes.\n"
"A3Q4AfterInitHratli"	"50\nKu Y'leh was a powerful sage who was \nrumored to have brewed a potion of \nimmortality. In an ironic twist of fate, \nhe was murdered before his potent \nelixir could take effect.\n"
"A3Q4AfterInitNatalya"	"78\nDon't tell me you believe in all of that \n'life after death' nonsense. You should \nbe more concerned with avoiding death \nthan making plans for after it finds \nyou.\n"
"A3Q4SuccessfulAlkor"	"120\nFrom the ashes of Ku Y'leh I have mixed \nfor you a potion.\n"
"A3Q4SuccessfulMeshifAct3"	"94\nImmortality is definitely not for me.\n \nCan you imagine having to wake up \nevery night just to piss for the next \nthousand years?\n"
"A3Q4SuccessfulCainAct3"	"63\nSo, Meshif had the Golden Bird all \nalong. I wonder if he knows what he \ngave up for that jade figurine.\n"
"A3Q4SuccessfulOrmus"	"54\nOrmus remembers the tale of Ku Y'leh. \nThat venerable sage forgot that there \nis no life beyond death. There is only \nlife.\n \nOnce prolonged unnaturally, it can \nbecome a living hell.\n"
"A3Q4SuccessfulNatalya"	"67\nI must admit, your foolish quest made \nlittle sense to me. But now I see the \nvalue of your actions. I believe you do \npossess great wisdom.\n"
"A3Q2InitCain"	"33\nNever forget that your ultimate purpose \nhere in Kurast is to destroy Mephisto. \nThe ancient Horadrim imprisoned the \nLord of Hatred inside the Guardian \nTower that is located within the Temple \nCity of Travincal.\n \nKnow this, friend. The only way to gain \nentry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy \nthe artifact known as the Compelling \nOrb.\n \nMephisto used this device to control the \nZakarum Priests and their followers. \nThe Orb can only be destroyed with an \nancient flail imbued with the spirit of \nthe one incorruptible priest.\n \nSoon after his imprisonment, Mephisto \nworked his evil corruption on the \nZakarum priesthood. All were turned to \nhis dark ways, save one - Khalim, the \nQue-Hegan of the High Council.\n \nMephisto directed the other Council \npriests to slay and dismember Khalim \nand then scatter his remains across \nthe Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur \nsucceeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, \neventually becoming the embodiment of \nMephisto here on the mortal plane.\n \nThe corrupted High Council fashioned \nan Orb to control the rest of the \nZakarum faithful and used their powers \nto hide the lair of their master from \nmortals.\n \nYour task is to collect the scattered \nrelics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, \nand his Eye. Then, using the Horadric \nCube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his \nrelics.\n \nOnce this is accomplished, you must \ndestroy the Compelling Orb with \nKhalim's Will to open the way into the \ncorrupt sanctum of Mephisto.\n"
"A3Q2EarlyReturnHeartCain"	"61\nYou have found Khalim's Heart, and it \nstill bears the courage to face \nMephisto!\n \nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with \nKhalim's other relics - the Eye, the \nBrain, and the Flail.\n"
"A3Q2EarlyReturnEyeCain"	"52\nAhh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal \nthe true path to Mephisto.\n \nPlace the Eye in the Horadric Cube \nalong with Khalim's other relics - the \nHeart, the Brain, and the Flail.\n"
"A3Q2EarlyReturnBrainCain"	"58\nThis is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain \nknows Mephisto's weakness.\n \nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with \nKhalim's other relics - the Eye, the \nHeart, and the Flail.\n"
"A3Q2EarlyReturnFlailCain"	"46\nOnce properly imbued, Khalim's Flail can \ndestroy the Compelling Orb and reveal \nthe way to Mephisto.\n \nPlace it into the Horadric Cube along \nwith Khalim's relics - his Heart, his \nBrain, and his Eye. Then, transmute \nthem to carry out Khalim's Will.\n"
"A3Q2SuccessfulCain"	"54\nMasterfully done, hero! You have \ncrafted Khalim's Will. Employ it to \ndestroy the Compelling Orb and open \nthe way to Mephisto. \n \nMay the true Light guide your way.\n"
"A3Q1InitAlkor"	"56\nIt pains me to waste time with you, so \nI'll get right to the point.\n \nThere is a very special book which you \nmust find for me. It was written long \nago by a sage known as Lam Esen, who \nstudied Skatsimi magic and the effects \nof the Prime Evils on the mortal world. \nThe Black Book was lost when the \nChildren of Zakarum took over this \nland.\n \nNow, you must reclaim it without delay! \nIts knowledge may aid us in this dark \ntime ahead.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitAlkor"	"73\nThe Black Book contains powerful \nsecrets of Skatsim, the Old Religion, \nlong eclipsed by Zakarum.\n \nI should warn you. The Black Book is \nmuch sought after by both good and \nevil. Be wary.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitOrmus"	"62\nThe Children of Zakarum believe that \nthe Black Book is filled with \nblasphemous heresy. In truth, the book \nmay contain the secrets to our ultimate \nredemption.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitMeshifAct3"	"73\nOh. No one really believes that the Black \nBook exists. It's just a symbol of \nZakarum's anti-Skatsim propaganda.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitAsheara"	"102\nMany things can be found in the city of \nKurast. The book may be there.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitHratli"	"54\nWe have long sought the Black Book of \nLam Esen. Rumors of its whereabouts \nspread as fast as jungle plagues. If you \nfind it, take it to Alkor.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitCainAct3"	"72\nThe Black Book is a powerful source of \ninformation. The Zakarum will do \neverything in their power to stop you \nfrom obtaining it.\n"
"A3Q1AfterInitNatalya"	"81\nI've heard of the Black Book. My Order's \ncode is based on many of its passages. \nIf you find it, I will be greatly \nimpressed.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnAlkor"	"104\nDid I neglect to mention that the book \ncontains useful information about the \nPrime Evils?\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnOrmus"	"55\nEven if you find the sacred Book, you \nmust still traverse the jungle of \nmeaning within it. That journey could \nprove to be far more perilous.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnMeshifAct3"	"56\nKurast was once the greatest city in the \nworld. Now it is hard to tell where the \njungle stops and the city begins. The \njungle grows rampant on the soil \nenriched by the blood of my fellow \ncitizens.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnAsheara"	"68\nI believe I can trust you now.\n \nWhen you first arrived, I suspected you \na spy for the Zakarum, the false \nreligion whose faithful are now under \nthe sway of a mysterious power. \nThey've made a mockery of the Old \nReligion of Skatsim.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnHratli"	"62\nNot getting much help?\n \nYou know, people are like rugs. Hang \nthem out a window and shake 'em a \ncouple times. You'll be surprised how \nmuch dirt comes out.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnCainAct3"	"81\nI heard that there are ruined temples in \nKurast. Perhaps you will find the Black \nBook in one of them.\n"
"A3Q1EarlyReturnNatalya"	"105\nI hope you find the Black Book soon. I \ncould use something to read while I \nwait for my orders.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulAlkor"	"83\nYou have found the Book! It should give \nall of us here some insight into the \nnature of the Prime Evils...\n \nAh, but as for you...\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulOrmus"	"70\nWhy is the Black Book of Lam Esen like \na coffin? Simple. Each holds the shape \nof our future.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulMeshifAct3"	"75\nThank all that's holy. You've returned \nwith the Black Book! Maybe now you \ncan put an end to the Evil that has \ndestroyed my homeland.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulAsheara"	"135\nThe Iron Wolves are very impressed by \nyour skills.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulHratli"	"74\nWe have the Book. Now we must see if \nwe can bear its revelations.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulCainAct3"	"86\nYou have found a source of information \npowerful enough to turn the tide \nagainst the Zakarum.\n"
"A3Q1SuccessfulNatalya"	"89\nSo, you've returned with the Book. You \nsurprise me. You must be very \nresourceful.\n"
"A3Q3InitHratli"	"45\nAs I told you before, I placed an \nenchantment upon the dockside in \norder to keep the demons at bay. But \nlately, the enchantment seems to be \nweakening.\n \nIf memory serves me correctly, there is \na holy Skatsimi blade that could \nrevitalize the enchantment. The blade \nis called the Gidbinn.\n \nFind it, and our sanctuary here will \nremain safe.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitAlkor"	"66\nHave you not heard of the Gidbinn? \nWell, allow me to reduce your \nignorance on the subject.\n \nThe Gidbinn is an enchanted dagger - a \nreligious artifact greatly valued by the \nOld Religion, Skatsim.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitOrmus"	"64\nOrmus is familiar with the Gidbinn. But \nhow would a powerful Skatsimi artifact \naid an unbeliever like you?\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitMeshifAct3"	"66\nThe Gidbinn is one of the few remaining \nrelics of Skatsim, the Old Religion. It is \nreputed to have great powers.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitAsheara"	"107\nThe Gidbinn will reinforce the \nenchantments that protect the \ndockside from the evil that infests \nKurast.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitHratli"	"54\nAs far as we know, the Gidbinn is in the \npossession of the Children of Light. \nThey do not wish it to fall into the \nhands of those who can restore its \npowers.\n \nYou may not believe it, but Ormus is the \none who can use the Gidbinn to protect \nus.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitCainAct3"	"55\nI've done some research on the Taan \nmage-clan, and it seems that most of \ntheir magical studies were focused on \nSkatsimi rites.\n \nIf anyone is qualified to use the powers \nof the Gidbinn, it would be Ormus.\n"
"A3Q3AfterInitNatalya"	"73\nDon't let the Gidbinn's size fool you. \nThough it is only a small dagger, it \nholds tremendous power when in the \nhands of a true Skatsimi mage.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnAlkor"	"70\nLegend has it that the Skatsimi priests \nplaced great power within the small \nblade. Power enough to repel this \nterrible jungle-curse which encroaches \non our sanctuary.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnOrmus"	"83\nIf we are to have peace from the \nshadow, you must find the weapon \nwhich will destroy the Light.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnMeshifAct3"	"67\nThe jungle is like nothing you've ever \nseen before. Imagine Paradise \nfestering like a wound... then bursting!\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnAsheara"	"145\nI'm certain that the Gidbinn is very \nclosely guarded.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnHratli"	"70\nOnce the Gidbinn is found, Ormus will \nuse it to strengthen the protective \nbarrier around the dockside.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnCainAct3"	"75\nSince you haven't come across the \nGidbinn yet, the dagger must be deeper \nin the jungle nearer Kurast.\n"
"A3Q3EarlyReturnNatalya"	"97\nYou'd best get back out there and find \nthat blade. The jungle creeps further \ninto this camp by the hour.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulAlkor"	"77\nHah! You have stolen the fabled blade \nfrom right under Zakarum's nose! This \nis a great day, indeed!\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulOrmus"	"41\nYou have done well, noble hero. Ormus \ncongratulates you. The old spirits of \nSkatsim will watch over you for \nreturning their sacred blade.\n \nNow, after all these years, Ormus will \nonce again use his powers to protect \nthe innocent from the shadow. The \nspell that protects the dockside shall \nnow be reinforced.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulMeshifAct3"	"79\nWith any luck, the spirits of Skatsim will \ngrant us revenge upon the powers that \nravaged this land.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulAsheara"	"99\nNow that fewer of the Iron Wolves are \nneeded to guard the dockside, some of \nthem have volunteered to accompany \nyou free of charge.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulHratli"	"80\nThe Gidbinn's magic can only be \nchanneled through Ormus.\n \nTake it to him. He has the necessary \nknowledge about the ancient Skatsimi \nmagics.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulCainAct3"	"62\nWho could have foreseen that the Old \nReligion would play such an effective \nrole in our war against the Three? \nAgain, your efforts amaze me, my \nfriend.\n"
"A3Q3SuccessfulNatalya"	"67\nYou are truly amazing, stranger. There \nare precious few items in the world \nthat would tempt me to go up against \nthe Children of Zakarum and their \nmidget minions.\n"
"A3Q3RewardOrmus"	"101\nThis magic ring does me no good.\n \nHere... Wear it proudly!\n"
"A3Q5InitOrmus"	"36\nYou have done well, my friend. Your \ncourage and valor are an inspiration to \nus all.\n \nBut now the time has come to face \nthose responsible for the evil that has \nstifled our land. You must destroy the \nHigh Council of Zakarum!\n \nLong ago, these elders were charged \nwith the stewardship of Mephisto, the \nLord of Hatred, who was imprisoned \nwithin the Guardian Tower.\n \nThrough the generations, these pious \nmen slowly fell more and more under \nthe sway of Mephisto's malevolent \npower and the Council became an evil \nmockery of its former glory. \n \nIt is Mephisto's Hatred that has \ncorrupted Zakarum and turned its \ndevout followers into paranoid \nfanatics. That is why you must travel \nto the Temple City of Travincal and \nslay the Council.\n \nOnce they are gone, Mephisto's hold \nover this land and its people will be \nbroken!\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitAlkor"	"84\nThe Black Book contains some vague \nprophecies regarding this undertaking. \nI'm not so sure it will turn out well for \nyou.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitAlkorVA"	"90\nI am but a potion dealer and an avid \nreader of occult books. What do I know \nof the Travincal?\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitOrmus"	"54\nYou must know that the Guardian Tower \nin the Temple City was built by the \nHoradrim for one purpose - to hold \nMephisto. Once the Council is dead, \nyou may enter the Tower.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitOrmusVA"	"54\nYou must know that the Guardian Tower \nin the Temple City was built by the \nHoradrim for one purpose - to hold \nMephisto. Once the Council is dead, \nyou may enter the Tower.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3"	"68\nThere is only one way to the Temple \nCity. You will have to cross many rivers \nand streams, but you'll find it. A great \ntower stands at its center.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitMeshifAct3VA"	"113\nIt has been said that Ormus speaks \nmost clearly when his ideas are utterly \nmad.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitAsheara"	"89\nThe Children of Zakarum who guard the \nTower square can be killed, but their \nnumbers are vast. You must destroy \ntheir Council.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitAshearaVA"	"105\nThere are many zealots among the \nfollowers of Zakarum. It will be difficult \nto get past them.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitHratli"	"104\nRemember. You can always find \nsanctuary here with us.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitHratliVA"	"75\nThis has been a trying time for all of us, \nbut I sense this nightmare is coming to \nan end.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3"	"63\nOrmus tells me that the Council is \ncomprised of tremendously powerful \npriests. It will be difficult to best them.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitCainAct3VA"	"93\nThe Temple City is well guarded. You'd \nbest keep your wits about you.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitNatalya"	"100\nYou are incredibly brave to venture into \nthe lion's den. I wish you luck.\n"
"A3Q5AfterInitNatalyaVA"	"95\nBeware the followers of Zakarum. Their \nfanaticism is their greatest weapon.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkor"	"111\nKill as many as you can. I have a \nmorbid love of excess.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnAlkorVA"	"91\nIf only we could have found the Black \nBook. I feel as though a malevolent \nhand has led us away from it.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnOrmus"	"49\nIf you die on this quest, I will \ncommemorate your sacrifice in an epic \npoem. You will not need a potion to \nachieve immortality. Ormus' words will \ndo that.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3"	"110\nWithin the Temple City is a courtyard. \nThe Council resides there.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA"	"107\nI have heard rumors that the Prime \nEvils are here seeking their Brother.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnAsheara"	"161\nThe Iron Wolves and I are at the ready \nto aid you.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnAshearaVA"	"139\nThings are getting wilder than Ladies \nNight at the Slippery Fist.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnHratli"	"65\nThe followers of Zakarum demand \ncomplete allegiance to their creed. \nThey have slaughtered many of their \nown for minor grievances.\n \nThey will not hesitate to kill you.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnHratliVA"	"75\nAfter having served Mephisto all these \nyears, the Council must be twisted by \nhatred and evil.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnCainAct3"	"81\nSankekur may be using a Compelling \nOrb to control the minds of the \nChildren of Zakarum.\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalya"	"80\nI respect your need to do this. Honor \ndemands that you see this through. Yet \nyour chances are so slim...\n"
"A3Q5EarlyReturnNatalyaVA"	"80\nI respect your need to do this. Honor \ndemands that you see this through. Yet \nyour chances are so slim...\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulAlkor"	"91\nYou've accomplished the impossible! By \nkilling the Council, the curse of \nZakarum will be lifted and our land will \nbe free!\n \nOh. Thank you!\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulOrmus"	"40\nOrmus is grateful to you, stranger. You \nhave broken the long, dark reign of \nZakarum and delivered the first \nparalyzing blow against the Three.\n \nYet still, the true test lies ahead. For he \nwhom the Council guarded still lives \nwithin the Blackened Tower.\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulMeshifAct3"	"76\nIt seems the jungle is already dying \nback. You've broken the curse, my \nfriend! May the Light bless you!\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulAsheara"	"125\nThe sun has set on the Religion of Light.\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulHratli"	"68\nThe followers of Zakarum lacked all \nsense of moderation. The collapse of \ntheir tainted religion gives me hope.\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulCainAct3"	"48\nRidding Kurast of the Council of \nZakarum was essential. Still, there is \nmore you must do. The Compelling Orb, \ntoo, must be destroyed.\n \nDiablo and Baal must be close to finding \ntheir brother, Mephisto, by now. You've \nno time to waste.\n"
"A3Q5SuccessfulNatalya"	"88\nI can hardly believe you did it. Your \npower blankets you like a shining aura.\n"
"A3Q6InitOrmus"	"53\nDiablo and Baal have surely found the \nTemple City by now. They seek to free \ntheir Brother, Mephisto, who was \nimprisoned by the Horadrim in the \nTemple's Guardian Tower.\n \nYou must reach him before his Brothers \ndo and prevent them from releasing \nHatred upon the world.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitAlkor"	"90\nThe hidden ways of the Tower are long \nforgotten. Though... it is rumored to \nhave been built as far below the \nground as above it.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitAlkorVA"	"114\nWe have seen Diablo, but remain unsure \nof his Brothers' whereabouts.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitOrmus"	"52\nMake haste! Though the Three are sure \nto reunite, it is uncertain as to what \nthey have planned once they do.\n \nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are \nmighty, no mortal can stand alone \nagainst the power of the Prime Evils.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitOrmusVA"	"52\nMake haste! Though the Three are sure \nto reunite, it is uncertain as to what \nthey have planned once they do.\n \nBe cautious, my friend. Though you are \nmighty, no mortal can stand alone \nagainst the power of the Prime Evils.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3"	"66\nBe careful when you return to the \nTower. Though many of the followers \nof Zakarum have fled, there's no telling \nwhat horrors still lurk inside it.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitMeshifAct3VA"	"116\nMove quickly, my friend, and end this \ncurse once and for all!\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitAsheara"	"60\nI sent a few of my Iron Wolves on a \nscouting mission into the jungle near \nthe Temple City... They encountered \ntwo cloaked men who attacked them \nwith horrifying powers.\n \nMy men barely survived. I have to \nassume that the two strangers are \nDiablo and Baal.\n \nYou'd better hurry. They're close to \nfinding their brother.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitAshearaVA"	"93\nMany Iron Wolves have disappeared in \nTravincal. The Evil is still strong there.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitHratli"	"43\nMephisto, along with Baal, was \noriginally captured in the desert near \nLut Gholein. But imprisoning two of the \nBrothers together was far too \ndangerous.\n \nThe Horadrim built the Guardian Tower \nto hold Mephisto. When Zakarum came \nto power in this land, it took over the \nTemple City without paying any heed to \nwhat was locked within the Tower.\n \nAnd it became their doom.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitHratliVA"	"73\nI hear there is a little family reunion \nabout to take place in Kurast. The \nThree brothers draw close.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3"	"116\nYou must reach Mephisto before his \nbrothers do.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitCainAct3VA"	"50\nThe ancient Horadrim always feared \nthat the Three would escape their \nprisons and unite. I can't believe that I, \nthe last of their Order, have seen it \ncome to pass.\n \nYou are the only one who can prevent \nthis, my friend. The final hour draws \nnear.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitNatalya"	"75\nNow you rush to face Mephisto. Don't \ngive in to your hatred. That is his \ngreatest weapon against you.\n"
"A3Q6AfterInitNatalyaVA"	"75\nNow you rush to face Mephisto. Don't \ngive in to your hatred. That is his \ngreatest weapon against you.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkor"	"68\nWell, the good news is that events are \nunfolding just as Lam Esen foretold. \nThe bad news is that the story ends in \nour utter ruin!\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnAlkorVA"	"80\nI'm afraid both fear and a large dose of \nelixir preclude me from answering.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmus"	"59\nI understand that the great Patriarch of \nZakarum, Sankekur, now embodies \nMephisto.\n \nYou must overcome Hatred lest Terror \nand Destruction claim us all!\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnOrmusVA"	"77\nI am loath to describe what will happen \nif Diablo and Baal release Mephisto.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3"	"110\nI ought to return to the ship. We may \nhave to sail from here very quickly.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnMeshifAct3VA"	"110\nI ought to return to the ship. We may \nhave to sail from here very quickly.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnAsheara"	"80\nThe sudden reduction in our ranks \nmakes us eager to destroy Diablo and \nhis brothers. Vengeance for the Iron \nWolves!\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnAshearaVA"	"200\nWe will fight to the death.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnHratli"	"58\nWhy build a Tower to place the beast \nbelow ground? At times I believe the \nHoradrim lacked common sense.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnHratliVA"	"106\nShouldn't you be running frantically up \nand down stairs about now?\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3"	"96\nSearch the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto \nmust not escape.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnCainAct3VA"	"96\nSearch the Tower thoroughly. Mephisto \nmust not escape.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalya"	"55\nBeware, my friend. Sankekur may be the \nmost powerful mortal in the world. He \ncontrols thousands of fanatical \nworshippers and embodies the Lord of \nHatred, himself. His death will be no \neasy task.\n"
"A3Q6EarlyReturnNatalyaVA"	"55\nBeware, my friend. Sankekur may be the \nmost powerful mortal in the world. He \ncontrols thousands of fanatical \nworshippers and embodies the Lord of \nHatred himself. His death will be no \neasy task.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulAlkor"	"71\nYour news is great indeed. You have \nsaved us all. I would smile, but I'm \nafraid my face might collapse.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulOrmus"	"48\nYou have defeated a Prime Evil in \ncombat. Ormus is impressed beyond \nwords. But staying here will not end \nthis conflict.\n \nYou must enter the Infernal Gate and \nstop Diablo once and for all.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulMeshifAct3"	"70\nAhh... Now, Kurast can begin the task \nof rekindling its former glory... I thank \nyou.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulAsheara"	"65\nWell done, my friend. You are a great \nchampion of Order. Please, consider \nyourself an honorary Iron Wolf.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulHratli"	"121\nIt looks like you're going to Hell before \nme.\n \nPut in a good word.\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulCainAct3"	"42\nOur faith in you was well deserved. But \nDiablo has made his way to Hell; and it \nis likely that Baal followed him there.\n \nEnter the Infernal Gate and kill the Lord \nof Terror before all is lost. Only then \nwill our world be saved!\n"
"A3Q6SuccessfulNatalya"	"55\nWord is spreading fast that you killed \nMephisto. I'd be honored to fight \nbeside you in Hell, but I've just received \nmy mission orders.\n \nI'll be travelling to the Barbarian lands \nof the North, but I can't tell you why. \nWith luck, our paths will cross again. \nFarewell.\n"
"TyraelActIntroGossip1"	"43\nIt is good to see you again, hero.\n \nMephisto's defeat is a great victory for \nthe Light. I knew that you would \neventually find your way here. The \nPandemonium Fortress is the last \nbastion of Heaven's power before the \nGates of the Burning Hells.\n \nThis place has been hallowed by the \nblood of thousands of champions of \nthe Light, many of whom were mortal, \nlike yourself. Now the final battle \nagainst the Prime Evils draws near... \nand you must face it alone. \n \nI have been forbidden to aid you \ndirectly, save for a few bits of wisdom. \nFor this is the hour of mortal Man's \ntriumph...your triumph.\n \nMay the Light protect you and the \npowers of Heaven shine upon your \npath...\n"
"TyraelAct4Gossip1"	"62\nLong ago, I swore an oath to watch \nover the Horadrim and their \ndescendants.\n \nAs Deckard Cain is the last of their \nesteemed Order, I will not allow him to \nperish here so far from the lands of his \nbirth.\n \nBe at ease, hero, I know that he is your \nfriend. He shall come to no harm.\n"
"CainAct4IntroGossip1"	"41\nCan you believe this place? Did you ever \ndare to dream that you'd one day \nstand upon the crossroads between \nHeaven and Hell? This Pandemonium \nFortress is truly miraculous.\n \nHowever, your journey is not yet over. \nDiablo still roams free in Hell, \nmarshalling his demonic forces. Only \nwhen he is beaten will our world finally \nhave peace.\n \nHurry now... the sands of time slow for \nno one! \n"
"CainAct4Gossip1"	"48\nI have read much about the enigmatic \nArchangel Tyrael. He was revered in \nHoradrim lore both for his compassion \nfor mortals and his unquenchable \nspirit.\n \nIt was rumored that he went against the \nwishes of Heaven and gave the \nHoradrim the original Soulstones in \norder to trap Diablo and his Brothers.\n"
"HellsAngelGossip1"	"72\nHalt! Before venturing into Diablo's lair, \ngo to the Hellforge with Mephisto's \nSoulstone.\n \nPlace the stone on the Hellforge and \nuse the Hellforge Hammer to destroy \nit.\n"
"HellsAngelGossip2"	"66\nProceed, hero, into Terror's lair.\n \nKnow that Diablo's innermost sanctum \nis hidden by five seals.\n \nOnly by opening each of these seals can \nyou clear your way to the final battle.\n"
"A4Q1InitTyrael"	"42\nThere is a dark, tortured soul who was \ntrapped within this forsaken realm long \nago. He was called Izual by mortal \nmen, and in ages past he was my most \ntrusted Lieutenant.\n \nYet, against my wishes he led an \nill-fated assault upon the fiery \nHellforge, itself.\n \nDespite his valor and strength, Izual \nwas captured by the Prime Evils and \ntwisted by their perverse power. They \nforced him to betray his own kind and \ngive up Heaven's most guarded \nsecrets.\n \nHe became a corrupt shadow of his \nformer self - a fallen angel trusted \nneither by Heaven nor Hell.\n \nFor his transgressions, Izual's spirit \nwas bound within the form of a terrible \ncreature which was summoned from \nthe Abyss. His maddened spirit has \nresided within that tortured husk for \nmany ages now.\n \nIt seems to me that he has suffered \nlong enough. I implore you, hero, find \nIzual and release him from his cruel \nimprisonment.\n \nPut an end to his guilt and suffering.\n"
"A4Q1AfterInitTyrael"	"59\nThough Izual no longer carries the \nAngelic Runeblade, Azurewrath, he may \nstill possess great strength and power \nwithin his new form.\n \nAlso, he may not be able to tell friend \nfrom foe while in his present state. If \nyou find him, he will almost certainly be \nhostile.\n \nProceed with the utmost caution.\n"
"A4Q1AfterInitCain"	"54\nTyrael has asked you to confront Izual \nthe Fallen? He must have great faith in \nyour abilities!\n \nI trust you know what you're doing... Be \ncareful. You're our last hope.\n"
"A4Q1EarlyReturnTyrael"	"75\nYou mustn't delay, mortal hero. Izual \nmust be put to rest, but Diablo still \nlurks within this realm.\n \nGo now... Hurry!\n"
"A4Q1EarlyReturnCain"	"83\nHaving trouble finding the Fallen Angel, \neh?\n \nYou'd better hurry. It's beginning to feel \nlike some great evil is permeating the \nair around here.\n"
"A4Q1SuccessfulIzual"	"47\nTyrael was a fool to have trusted me!\n \nYou see, it was I who told Diablo and his \nBrothers about the Soulstones and how \nto corrupt them. It was I who helped \nthe Prime Evils mastermind their own \nexile to your world.\n \nThe plan we set in motion so long ago \ncannot be stopped by any mortal \nagency. Hell, itself, is poised to spill \nforth into your world like a tidal wave \nof blood and nightmares.\n \nYou and all your kind... are doomed.\n"
"A4Q1SuccessfulTyrael"	"53\nThank you, hero, for putting Izual's \ntortured spirit to rest. May the Light \nprotect you and the powers of Heaven \nshine upon your path.\n \nBut, if what you tell me is true, then I \nfear that we have been played for fools \nall along.\n \nIzual helped Diablo and his Brothers \ntrick me into using the Soulstones \nagainst them... Now the Stones' powers \nare corrupted.\n \nWith the combined powers of the \nSoulstones under their control, the \nPrime Evils will be able to turn the \nmortal world into a permanent outpost \nof Hell!\n"
"A4Q1SuccessfulCain"	"68\nYou're lucky to be alive, my friend! It is \nimperative that you find and stop \nDiablo!\n \nYou should speak of this with Tyrael. He \nwill know what to make of this.\n"
"A4Q3InitHasStoneCain"	"53\nThe time has come for you to destroy \nMephisto's Soulstone!\n \nTake the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it \nupon the forge and strike it soundly \nwith the Hammer.\n \nOnly by doing this can you prevent \nMephisto from manifesting in this \nworld ever again.\n"
"A4Q3InitNoStoneCain"	"50\nThe time has come to destroy \nMephisto's Soulstone! \n \nAlthough I picked it up before entering \nthe Infernal Gate, I believe you should \ncarry out this crucial mission.\n \nTake the Stone to the Hellforge. Place \nit upon the forge and strike it soundly \nwith the Hammer.\n \nOnly by doing this can you prevent \nMephisto from manifesting in this \nworld ever again.\n"
"A4Q3SuccessfulCain"	"70\nCongratulations, hero!\n \nSurely, even Diablo, himself, sensed the \nfury unleashed when you smashed his \nBrother's Soulstone.\n"
"A4Q2InitTyrael"	"48\nThe time has come to hunt down and \ndestroy Diablo, himself.\n \nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to \nbe underestimated. He single-handedly \ndestroyed the town of Tristram and \ncorrupted the last noble hero who tried \nto stop him.\n \nThis time, you must defeat him for \ngood. Only by destroying the Soulstone \nwhich he carries will his spirit be \nbanished forever.\n \nGood luck! Though this be our darkest \nhour, it may yet be your greatest \nmoment.\n"
"A4Q2AfterInitCain"	"54\nYou don't have time to dally about here!\n \nDiablo awaits you in Hell. Remember... \nDiablo's greatest weapon against you is \nTerror.\n \nDon't give in to your fears. Resist his \npower and put an end to him for good!\n"
"A4Q2AfterInitTyrael"	"48\nThe time has come to hunt down and \ndestroy Diablo, himself.\n \nBut beware, the Lord of Terror is not to \nbe underestimated.

"A4Q2SuccessfulTyrael"	"62\nPraise be to the Light! You have \naccomplished the impossible!\n \nDiablo and Mephisto have been \nbanished back into the Black Abyss \nthat spawned them and the corrupted \nSoulstones are no more.\n \nYou've done well, hero. For now, you \nshould rejoice.\n"
"A4Q2SuccessfulCain"	"42\nI knew there was great potential in you, \nmy friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n \nThough my ancestors often struggled \nagainst the Three Evils and their \nminions, I've always lived a shut-in, \nscholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom \naided you.\n \nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though \nHeaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, \nI hope I won't have to see them again \nfor many, many years.\n"

"EnterCatacombsNec"	"I sense a demonic presence here."
"CompletingDOEAma"	"Perhaps now the Sisters will trust me."
"CompletingDOEBar"	"The Rogues are safe for the moment."

"FindingInifusBar"	"This tree is one of a kind."
"FindingInifusPal"	"This tree bristles with magic!"
"FindingInifusSor"	"This ancient tree has an aura of magic about it."
"FindingInifusNec"	"This tree shines with inner spirits."
"FindingCairnAma"	"These stones serve some magical purpose..."

"FindingTristramPal"	"What a tragic end to Tristram!"
"FindingTristramSor"	"Tristram was no match for Diablo's fury."

"CompletingRadamentSor"	"What a misguided monster."
"CompletingRadamentNec"	"What a waste of undead flesh."
"BeginTaintedSunAma"	"Great. An eclipse. This just keeps getting better and better."
"BeginTaintedSunBar"	"What is wrong with the sun?"
"BeginTaintedSunPal"	"What Evil taints the light of the sun?"
"BeginTaintedSunSor"	"Only powerful magic can conjure an eclipse."
"BeginTaintedSunNec"	"Only the darkest magics can turn the sun black."
"EnteringClawViperAma"	"I hope I know what I'm doing!"
"EnteringClawViperBar"	"The sun has never shone here!"
"EnteringClawViperPal"	"Light guide my way in this accursed place."
"EnteringClawViperSor"	"I sense strong magic within this place."
"EnteringClawViperNec"	"This place is as dark as a tomb."
"CompletingTaintedSunAma"	"Let there be light."
"CompletingTaintedSunBar"	"It is good to know that the sun shines once again."
"CompletingTaintedSunPal"	"The Light can never be extinguished by evil."
"CompletingTaintedSunSor"	"Who would have thought that such primitive beings could cause so much trouble!"
"CompletingTaintedSunNec"	"What a pity. I was beginning to enjoy the darkness."
"EnteringArcaneAma"	"Am I the first to find this Arcane fortress?"
"EnteringArcaneBar"	"One could get lost in here."
"EnteringArcanePal"	"This surely is the product of a twisted mind!"
"EnteringArcaneSor"	"This place actually... distorts reality. Fascinating."
"EnteringArcaneNec"	"This is fantastic! I wish I had time to study this bizarre dimension."
"FindingSummonerAma"	"What a freak!"
"FindingSummonerBar"	"Stand aside, old fool. I have no time for your babblings."
"FindingSummonerPal"	"Surely the evil here has driven you mad."
"FindingSummonerSor"	"Is this truly Horazon?"
"FindingSummonerNec"	"This bumbling fool cannot be the mighty Horazon!"
"CompletingSummonerAma"	"Good riddance, freak."
"CompletingSummonerBar"	"I hate staining my hands with the blood of foul sorcerers."
"CompletingSummonerPal"	"Rest in peace, tortured soul."
"CompletingSummonerSor"	"That couldn't have been Horazon. Poor wretch."
"CompletingSummonerNec"	"He was not Horazon. He was a deluded fool who got too close to true power!"
"FindingdecoyTombAma"	"This has got to be the right place."
"FindingdecoyTombBar"	"This tomb is very ornate. This must be Tal Rasha's resting place."
"FindingdecoyTombPal"	"Is this the tomb I seek?"
"FindingdecoyTombSor"	"This tomb has Horadric markings. I wonder if this is Tal Rasha's tomb?"
"FindingdecoyTombNec"	"This could be Tal Rasha's tomb. However, I'm sensing very strange energies here."
"FindingTrueTombAma"	"Should I enter...? Diablo and Baal may have laid a trap..."
"FindingTrueTombBar"	"Such a cold breeze... Tal Rasha must be kept here."
"FindingTrueTombPal"	"Here, at last, is a fitting testament in stone to Tal Rasha's sacrifice."
"FindingTrueTombSor"	"This must be the true Tomb of Tal Rasha!"
"FindingTrueTombNec"	"I sense an incredible aura about this tomb. The Horadrim hid something powerful inside."
"CompletingTombAma"	"This is not good. Will this madness ever end?"
"CompletingTombBar"	"I have failed. Diablo has freed his accursed brother. The world remains at their mercy."
"CompletingTombPal"	"I shall honor Tal Rasha's sacrifice by destroying all the Prime Evils."
"CompletingTombSor"	"Diablo and Baal have escaped me! Next time... vengeance!"
"CompletingTombNec"	"I came too late. Now... Destruction is let loose upon the world once more."
"nodarkwanderer"	"Not in Game"
"FindingLamEsenAma"	"I hope the secrets within this book can help us."
"FindingLamEsenBar"	"I hope this book is worth all the trouble."
"FindingLamEsenPal"	"The Black Book... It's heresy to the Zakarum High Council."
"FindingLamEsenSor"	"This tome has the weight of knowledge about it."
"FindingLamEsenNec"	"This ancient book radiates arcane power!"
"CompletingLamEsenAma"	"All this trouble over a tattered book."
"CompletingLamEsenBar"	"May this book lift the shadow from Kurast."
"CompletingLamEsenPal"	"May the Black Book deliver us from evil!"
"CompletingLamEsenSor"	"May the Black Book bring a black day to hell!"
"CompletingLamEsenNec"	"Once the book has served its purpose, I shall delve into its secrets."
"FindingBeneathCityAma"	"Whoa.... What died down here?"
"FindingBeneathCityBar"	"Cough... The stench down here is choking!"
"FindingBeneathCityPal"	"The smell of death... or worse... surrounds me."
"FindingBeneathCitySor"	"It smells worse than rotting reagents down here."
"FindingBeneathCityNec"	"It's been years since I waded through sewers for fun."
"FindingDrainLeverAma"	"I hope this does something good..."
"FindingDrainLeverBar"	"This will drain out some of the filth."
"FindingDrainLeverPal"	"This appears to control the ancient valves."
"FindingDrainLeverSor"	"This looks promising."
"FindingDrainLeverNec"	"This looks like what I've been searching for."
"CompletingBeneathCityAma"	"Eureka!"
"CompletingBeneathCityBar"	"Good. Now I can get out of here and get some fresh air!"
"CompletingBeneathCityPal"	"This trove will help lift the curse from Kurast!"
"CompletingBeneathCitySor"	"I hope these items can aid me against the demons."
"CompletingBeneathCityNec"	"Great. More junk. Just what I'd expect to find in a sewer..."
"CompletingBladeAma"	"This dagger will separate the faithful from the fallen."
"CompletingBladeBar"	"This holy blade does not belong in the hands of the Zakarum."
"CompletingBladePal"	"This blade shall pierce the heart of evil!"
"CompletingBladeSor"	"I must take this to Ormus."
"CompletingBladeNec"	"This is a powerful weapon. Perhaps Ormus can tell me more about it."
"FindingJadeFigAma"	"A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better."
"FindingJadeFigAma"	"A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better."
"FindingJadeFigAma"	"A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better."
"FindingJadeFigAma"	"A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better."
"FindingJadeFigAma"	"A worthless statue. Perhaps I can trade this for something better."
"FindingTempleAma"	"Such a dark temple for a Religion of Light..."
"FindingTempleBar"	"The spirits of nature have fled this dreaded place."
"FindingTemplePal"	"This corrupted temple was once the shining heart of my religion..."
"FindingTempleSor"	"I sense tremendous evil within this place."
"FindingTempleNec"	"This temple exudes darkness."
"CompletingTempleAma"	"Skatsim's reign is renewed!"
"CompletingTempleBar"	"The dark powers here will no longer poison the land."
"CompletingTemplePal"	"The Temple shall shine anew with the Light."
"CompletingTempleSor"	"The Temple's power is annulled."
"CompletingTempleNec"	"The Temple's dark power is broken."
"FindingGuardianTowerAma"	"This must be where Mephisto is."
"FindingGuardianTowerBar"	"The final resting place of Hatred itself."
"FindingGuardianTowerPal"	"This must be where the Horadrim imprisoned Mephisto."
"FindingGuardianTowerSor"	"Ah... Mephisto's prison."
"FindingGuardianTowerNec"	"The Tower that holds Mephisto...."
"CompletingGuardianTowerAma"	"Success... But still there's something not right."
"CompletingGuardianTowerBar"	"Maybe now the world will have peace."
"CompletingGuardianTowerPal"	"The Lord of Hatred shall darken the world no longer."
"CompletingGuardianTowerSor"	"Mephisto shall no longer darken our souls with hatred."
"CompletingGuardianTowerNec"	"Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss."
"FreezingIzualAma"	"Wait... Don't I get three wishes?"
"FreezingIzualBar"	"Even Fallen Angels deserve freedom."
"FreezingIzualPal"	"How can one who was once so holy fall so far from righteousness?"
"FreezingIzualSor"	"He was corrupted to the core. I pity him."
"FreezingIzualNec"	"Bah! Izual was weak. He squandered his infernal power."
